Harvard University's introduction

7
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:26,267
to the intellectual
enterprises of computer science

8
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,758
and the art of programming.

9
00:00:27,758 --> 00:00:31,240
We are so excited to have an
amazing alum here with us today.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,470
He was a member of the
Harvard class of 1977.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,750
He concentrated in
applied math economics.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,770
And he was a resident of Currier House.

>> [AUDIENCE CHEERING]

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,550
>> He was manager of the
Harvard football team,

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,020
advertising manager of the Crimson,
and publisher of the Harvard Advocate.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,230
And upon graduation, he headed off
for a to Stanford's business school,

17
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,090
but didn't stay long, as he was
quickly recruited by a friend of his

18
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,650
to a little company we all know now
as Microsoft, where he served first

19
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,640
as business manager, later as CEO, and
is now the owner of the LA Clippers.

>> STEVE BALLMER: Well, thanks.

25
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,310
I'm honored to have a chance
to be here with you today.

26
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,780
When I first talked to
David about this, he said,

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,280
I'd really like you to come on
in and give an advanced lecture

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,350
in machine learning and
computational thinking.

29
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,190
We didn't dwell on that idea very long.

30
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,870
>> So I thought I'd give
you a little talk--

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,290
if I can figure out which
space bar I'm hitting--

32
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,900
what do we need to do to change?

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,250
I won't touch that one.

34
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,390
This one I won't touch.

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,580
There we go.

36
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,010
OK.

37
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,520
>> I thought I'd give you a little-- you've
got to be a competitor in business.

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,230
Anyway, I thought we'd
talk a little bit today,

39
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,530
just a few thoughts, on
most of what I learned

40
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,190
I learned at Harvard University.

41
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,230
I thought I'd try to summarize that
in about nine easy steps and then four

42
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,810
things I learned after
I got out of this place,

43
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,510
and hopefully get all through
that in about 25 minutes-- just

44
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,580
to give you a little
bit of food for thought.

45
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,350
And then we'll do Q&A.

46
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:45,470
>> I am 99.999999999% sure that
nothing we talk about today

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,330
will matter for your grade
or will appear on the final.

48
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,570
I think you're as safe
as rain on that today.

49
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:59,974
But hopefully, get you thinking about
a couple things as we go through.

50
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:02,640
First thing that's probably
important for you to register-- this

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,560
is sort of academically dangerous--
of all those many important things

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,330
I learned at Harvard, it
wasn't in the classroom.

53
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,170
As I listened to David do the
introduction, I thought to myself,

54
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,130
it sounds like I majored in
extracurriculars when I was here.

55
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,160
That's actually true.

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,730
I attended all of one
class session senior year.

57
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,370
Junior year was a little bit better.

58
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,870
>> With modern technology, I don't
know what the possibilities are,

59
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,340
but they would seem to
be even greater today

60
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,650
for mischief outside the classroom.

61
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:45,680
But I will tell you it was really
very, very formative and seminal.

62
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,430
I arrived here in 1973.

63
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,580
And I was hell bent and determined
that I was going to get my Ph.D.

64
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,600
in either math or physics.

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,880
And about the only
thing to figure out was

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,740
whether it was going
to be math or physics.

67
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,370
That was it.

68
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,770
That's all that needed
to be figured out.

69
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,910
>> Freshman year, the big
decision was whether to take

70
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,960
Physics 55-- I don't know if that
course still exists-- or Math 55.

71
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:21,279
I thought I'd take both, and the kindly
adviser said, young Steve, big mistake.

72
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,320
I won't allow you to do that.

73
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,240
So I took one of them and did an
independent study in the other.

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,760
And thank god I did.

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,570
>> First lesson, I learned
very, very early.

76
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,000
Freshman year, I took my first exam.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,720
I took my first exam.

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,820
I walked out of it.

79
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,680
I called my parents and said, I
think I just flunked out of school.

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,310

81
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,470
I was already involved with the
Harvard football team doing statistics.

82
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,250
I was supposed to go down to Penn, so it
must have been about this time of year,

83
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,350
since the schedule for football
hasn't changed in 50 years.

84
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,940
>> We were supposed to go down Penn.

85
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,320
I didn't go, because I was crest fallen
that I had flunked out of school.

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,415
I got my exam back the next
week, and sure enough, I

87
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:12,880
had gotten a 33, which was about
fifth or sixth in the class.

88
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:21,430
The guy who got 75 is Ph.D. in
physics, is a professor of physics,

89
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,230
and is a genius.

90
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,690
So it took me about two months
to learn I wasn't a physicist

91
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,940
and I wasn't a genius.

92
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:35,780
And everything good started right there
with my first big failure, so to speak.

93
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,370
>> I just finished giving a class,
actually, at the business school

94
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,570
at Stanford.

95
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,830
And I worked with a lady who had been a
professor here at Harvard in economics

96
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,760
and now is at Stanford Business School.

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:55,560
And I took the opportunity to look
back and reflect on, let me say,

98
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,750
important lessons that I've
learned over the time of my life,

99
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,300
but particularly that mattered
to me as I was running Microsoft.

100
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,350
>> And I'm not going to try to
go through the detail of each,

101
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,290
but I summarise them in short form.

102
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,670
And when I stopped and looked
back and I said, how many of those

103
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,970
relate to something concretely that I
got out of my experience at Harvard,

104
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,330
the answer turns out to be very high.

105
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,570
>> Small show of hands-- how many
freshman do we have in the class?

106
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,930
Sophomores?

107
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,550
Juniors?

108
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,780
Seniors trying to get that
last CS in before you leave?

109
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,740
OK, good.

110
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,690
>> I will tell you that in reflection, the
amount you can get out of this place

111
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,860
is stunning.

112
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,630
My best friends, many of them I
met to this day while I was here.

113
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,070
The formative experiences, I got here.

114
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,520
And everybody tells
you, but it's amazing

115
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
what you can get out of the place.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,914
>> Number one for me, life
lesson, is ideas matter.

117
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:03,580
Now, people say, of course ideas matter.

118
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,430
What kind of stupid life
lesson is it that ideas matter?

119
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:13,060
The truth of the matter is this is
both under and over appreciated.

120
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,800
Most people think every idea is a
good idea as long as they had it.

121
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
The truth of the matter is
not every idea is a good idea.

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,140
Not every idea matters.

123
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,910
And not every idea should be pursued.

124
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:31,070
>> And if you're in a field like
I am or was of innovation,

125
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,300
not every idea is a good idea, even if
it strikes you that way on first blush.

126
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,870
In fact, most people are
lucky to have one idea that

127
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,120
really matters in their whole life.

128
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
That's not a criticism.

129
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,510
But earth shattering,
life changing ideas

130
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:50,820
are very few and far between--
research insights, investment insights,

131
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,260
innovations.

132
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,780
A good idea needs to be
cherished and nurtured.

133
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,910
And in some senses, you could say I
learned that here at Microsoft-- here

134
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,540
at Microsoft-- here at Harvard.

135
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,950
>> [LAUGHTER]

136
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,910
>> I actually know what's
on the slide, though.

137
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,890
I learned it here.

138
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:12,694
Microsoft was started here by Bill
Gates and Paul Allen when I was here.

139
00:08:12,694 --> 00:08:14,860
When I finally joined the
company, it was five years

140
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,039
after Microsoft got started.

141
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,330
Some people would say it got started up
at the Currier House, but it really got

142
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,360
started up at the housing
project up at Ringe,

143
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,250
which is where Paul Allen was living.

144
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,260
>> But this notion, which
Microsoft started,

145
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,080
was the idea that software represented
a form of free intelligence,

146
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,010
and that if you coupled it with this
new essentially free intelligence

147
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,350
in the form of the microprocessor,
unbelievable things would happen.

148
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,060
And that basic idea that
software was a mobilizing force

149
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,310
for this new microprocessor, which was
free-- that obviously was a big idea.

150
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,250
>> And that was the idea
that Paul Allen and Bill

151
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,500
Gates had when they started the company.

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,300
And ideas do matter.

153
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,780
And it is worth considering
and not falling in love

154
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,230
with every idea you have, whether
you're trying to solve a problem set

155
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,880
or you're trying to do something else.

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,970
>> Second thing I learned
is there is an advantage

157
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,290
to being what I like
to call now hardcore.

158
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,170
Hardcore-- I don't know
quite how to describe it.

159
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:29,690
It's a combination of tenacious
and dedicated and passionate and

160
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,090
committed-- something
like that, hardcore.

161
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,360
>> I learned about being hardcore
from math concentrators at Harvard.

162
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,660
>> [LAUGHTER]

163
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,180
>> I'm not going to ask whether we
have any math concentrators here.

164
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,110
But I would say that's
where I got my lesson.

165
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,759
People could just go crazy-- focused.

166
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,550
And it wasn't just that
people were genius,

167
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,750
but working and working
and working and working.

168
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,740
I'd sit in my room working on a
problem set, and after three hours--

169
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,850
I'm a little ADD-- I
just couldn't take it.

170
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,070
The most hardcore people could
just power through anything.

171
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:11,290
>> And the advantage of being
that tenacious and dedicated

172
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,470
and committed-- I claim
it helped us at Microsoft.

173
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,210
It was fundamental at Microsoft.

174
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,750
But I learned it here at Harvard.

175
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,740
>> Passion-- I think it's probably fair
for me to say at this stage in my life

176
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,920
that basketball is a passion.

177
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,492
I started keeping track
of rebounds and assists.

178
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,190
$12 a game I used to get paid.

179
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:36,815
I went to every Harvard basketball
game, which I would have gone to anyway.

180
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:41,620
But I got paid $12 to keep
track of rebounds and assists.

181
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,270
>> And I will say that finding
your passion is something

182
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,350
you get to do almost in
a unique way in college.

183
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,910
And finding the things that
you are passionate about

184
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,010
is probably the most
important thing that you

185
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,410
get to really start doing
when you get to college.

186
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,080
Before college, everything's
about getting to college.

187
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
It's unfortunate, but I know it's true.

188
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,000
>> Here, take the time to
explore your passion.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,790
I now this year will probably go
to about 200 basketball games.

190
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,480
I think it's fair to
say it is a passion.

191
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,620
But sitting there in the old IAB, which
I think is called the Malkin Center,

192
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,760
marking down-- there's
a guy named Lou Silver

193
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,630
who played on the Harvard
basketball team in 1975.

194
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,960
I gave him the benefit of the
doubt on every rebound ever.

195
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,940
I think I was part of
his All Ivy success.

196
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,230
And who was one of the first guys to
email me when I bought the LA Clippers?

197
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,760
Lou Silver-- passion
built early in life.

198
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,300
>> Own the results.

199
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,210
This is actually, I think, one of the
hardest things for college kids to get,

200
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,850
especially kids at Harvard,
which is at the end of the day,

201
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,670
it's not just about whether
you have a good idea

202
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,620
and whether you're really
talented and really smart.

203
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,610
That's enough to get you into a lot
of good colleges, including this one.

204
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,010
>> But all of those things are
not really measures of success.

205
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,130
You have to do something other than
make grades and get measured on them

206
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,630
in life.

207
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,280
That's generally how the world works.

208
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,580
And really being
accountable for outcomes

209
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,870
makes you better at everything you do.

210
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,430
I comped for the Crimson and had to
go sell $1,000 worth of advertising.

211
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,430
That was a lot of money.

212
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,360
I don't know what the numbers would be
these days-- but $1,000 of ad revenue,

213
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,460
and then took on ad sales.

214
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,156
>> And feeling the pressure,
particularly at an institution

215
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:44,030
that basically has no
money-- at least that's

216
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,070
where the Crimson was 35
years ago-- it's good for you.

217
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,570
It's good for the soul.

218
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,560
And it actually makes you better at
everything you do to own outcomes.

219
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,110
>> Time-- how many people in the
room would say they are too busy?

220
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,840
Not busy enough?

221
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,360
That's a politically unpopular
place to put your hand,

222
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,070
but God bless you for putting
your hand up over there.

223
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,720
The truth of the matter is,
thinking about time as something

224
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,650
to be managed, whether it's how long--
for those of you who are seniors,

225
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,820
I'm sure you'll ask the question,
how long will I do my first job?

226
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,340
How long?

227
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,460
Will I stay in my job six
months, a year, five years?

228
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,600
>> How long before I decide
whether I really like my career?

229
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,930
How long before I really like my major?

230
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,120
How am I really managing my time?

231
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,200
>> I got involved in a lot
of extracurriculars.

232
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,220
The one that broke the bank for me was
becoming publisher of the Advocate.

233
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,594
I'm not even sure why I did.

234
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:47,010
Really, I'm not sure why I did it.

235
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,020
It was another resume build.

236
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,970
I was already busy with
football and the Crimson.

237
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,150
>> But I did it.

238
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:58,170
And then time management
really got into my vocabulary.

239
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,100
I really did have to manage--
and I don't even measure it.

240
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,370
I started skipping class.

241
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,500
I already confessed to that.

242
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,350
But managing time even
amongst the extracurriculars

243
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,520
got to be a big, big deal.

244
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,024
>> Today, I actually keep a
spreadsheet, a bunch of them.

245
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:15,190
These are all the things
I'm going to do in my life.

246
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,310
Here's how much time is budgeted
to them, and allocate it.

247
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,370
I record everything into Outlook.

248
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,330
I have a macro that
spits it out in Excel.

249
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,850
And I do budget versus
actual comparisons.

250
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,550
>> It's a little different since
I've, quote, retired, unquote.

251
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,060
But at Microsoft, I could tell you I was
going to have 12 one on ones with Harry

252
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,964
this year.

253
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,130
And then I would track them.

254
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,740
How many did I have?

255
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,950
I was going to spend 10 hours a year
talking to customers over the telephone

256
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,980
versus in person.

257
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,330
And I just measure everything,
because I think time is so important.

258
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:58,380
>> Storytelling-- I think in
whatever you choose to do in life,

259
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,810
even if you're going to be the most
hardcore, dedicated computer engineer,

260
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:09,690
learning to tell a story, whether you
do it with my-- I can't write a lick,

261
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,890
but I'm not bad at a
speech, but my speech style

262
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,650
is very different than
people standing at podiums.

263
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,840
It's very different.

264
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,780
>> Being able to tell a story through
your work, through your speech,

265
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,430
through your writing is so important.

266
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,020
You want a grant application?

267
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,260
You better tell your story.

268
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,250
You want your start up idea funded?

269
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,490
You better tell your story.

270
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,610
You want to be the top
engineer on the team who's

271
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,350
compelling vision about
where the product should go?

272
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,040
You better be able to tell a story.

273
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,340
>> And in general, I don't
think people come out

274
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,950
of school well versed in storytelling.

275
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,450
On the other hand, as
Harvard football manager,

276
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:57,750
I had to get up every team meal-- listen
up, everbody-- and make announcement

277
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,150
for the coaches.

278
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,250
And I got to tell you, being a manager
is not a lofty, revered position.

279
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,040
At least, it wasn't 40 years ago.

280
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,135
I'm sure now it's very different,
because the whole system has changed.

281
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,760
But you'd get up there and you'd
say, how do I tell this story?

282
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,218
What am I really going to announce?

283
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:15,380
What am I going to do?

284
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,530
Even learning to give speeches--
I was very shy as a kid.

285
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,400
And being a Harvard
football manager for me

286
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,600
was like this huge,
transformative experience.

287
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,220
>> The last lesson I learned at
Harvard is-- not literally,

288
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,490
but figuratively-- it's
get in the weight room.

289
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,430
The weight room in sports
is where you get in shape.

290
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,010
You build new muscles.

291
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,010
You build new flexibility.

292
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,140
You learn to do new things
because you have new capabilities.

293
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,340
>> In life, you have to
stay in the weight room.

294
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,990
You have to keep evolving, building
new skills, learning new things.

295
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,460
And that's easy to say, but
a lot of people don't do it.

296
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:59,070
You could say, OK, well, people
who go into the tech industry

297
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,750
all do-- not true.

298
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,160
>> I'll just give you
one big transformation

299
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,240
that's happening in the world today.

300
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,560
Most people who are my age
learned a form of computer science

301
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,990
where you wrote a program
that took inputs and gave

302
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,460
you outputs that were
correct or incorrect.

303
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,099
Most modern programming says,
give me a bunch of inputs

304
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:28,450
and I'm going to statistically guess
about what might be interesting here.

305
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,650
>> That's a very new skill.

306
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,480
And if you find people who are, let's
say, 10 or 15 years out of college,

307
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,730
they don't think that way
technologically, even to this day.

308
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,130
And so the need-- whether it's in
your career or in your life-- for me

309
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,740
at Harvard, I taught Math A?

310
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,060
Does Math A still exist as a course?

311
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,070
It was pre-calculus.

312
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,160
>> Suffice it to say, because I thought
of myself as some super math guy,

313
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,080
I had to learn to take concepts
and explain them simply.

314
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,550
I was teaching pre-calc, something
I had done five years earlier.

315
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,910
And the ability to build
new skills-- I point

316
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,350
to the experience of
doing that at Harvard.

317
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,370
>> Beyond Harvard-- yeah, there
were still a few things to learn.

318
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,950
I know this is the best institution,
absolutely, in the world.

319
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,100
I was at the Boston Globe
today talking about Harvard,

320
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,050
number one in everything.

321
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,720
I bleed Harvard.

322
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,630
But I actually learned a couple
things after I got out of Harvard.

323
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,770
>> The first message I
would say is in life,

324
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,890
you want to be your own quarterback.

325
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,350
See the playing field.

326
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,790
Many people like to get
myopically tied into one thing,

327
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,630
and they have a hard time stepping back.

328
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,810
Being CO of Microsoft is this
amazing, wonderful opportunity.

329
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:55,080
It turns out, everybody in the
world wants to tell you what to do.

330
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,580
And they'll educate you.

331
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,310
>> You want to learn about
any field of technology?

332
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,440
As long as you don't act like a know
it all, somebody will educate you.

333
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,030
And you have a unique ability to see
broadly across the technology field.

334
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,710
Right now, I'm spending a lot of my time
studying government and the economy.

335
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,560
>> It turns out the number
of places you can actually

336
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:22,600
read about the totality of government
in the United States is almost zero.

337
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,880
What is the total spent in
government in this country,

338
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,320
and what does it get spent on?

339
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,420
There's no government
report on that topic.

340
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,982
>> The best site happens to come from
some random blogger who I met,

341
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:37,440
who I think it's great, by the way.

342
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,910
But I found him through our Bing
search engine, not surprisingly.

343
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:44,810
>> [LAUGHTER]

344
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,750
>> That's my only plug for today.

345
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,310
I'm still a shareholder--
but seeing the field.

346
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:56,220
In life, it's always good to be the
first person to achieve something.

347
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,960
It turns out the guy who wins is
the guy who was doing it last.

348
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,740
So it's always best to invent a new
idea, be the first to do something.

349
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,990
But ultimately, it's about committing to
be successful and to stay at something.

350
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,190
It's sort of a corollary
of being hardcore.

351
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,340
>> And certainly, there are
fields of Microsoft's success,

352
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,470
like selling to large enterprises, where
when we started on that in the '80s,

353
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,990
people said, you'll never do it.

354
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,340
That's all IBM's purview.

355
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,720
And today, that would be 70%
or 83% of Microsoft profits

356
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,860
come because we failed at something
for 20 years but we kept at it.

357
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:44,070
>> Corollary to ideas matter--
it's hard to have a second idea.

358
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,580
If you really study the tech industry,
most tech companies have one idea,

359
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,241
and as long as the idea is hot, they
stay hot and then they fade to black.

360
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:55,990
If you look at all the companies
that were important in technology

361
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,810
when I got to Microsoft in
1980, only IBM is still around.

362
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,140
And I might argue it's not
a tech company anymore.

363
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,190
>> And my great dream for Microsoft
is that it is, so to speak,

364
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,370
a two, three, or four trick pony.

365
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,330
I said someplace that I thought
Apple and Microsoft were amazing

366
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,900
because they were two trick ponies, and
somebody thought I was bashing Apple.

367
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,550
No, that's my ultimate compliment.

368
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:26,170
>> Anybody who can have two good-- if you
have one idea, I think you're amazing.

369
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,850
If you have two ideas, you're
lionized in history for your success.

370
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,650
It's really interesting.

371
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,090
>> Optimim-- Colin Powell came to speak
one year at our executive retreat

372
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,740
after he had been Head of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

373
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,230
And he has this quote
that I have come to love.

374
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:48,270
"Optimism is a force multiplier."

375
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,380
And particularly amongst technical
people and really smart people,

376
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,740
the chic, chic, cool thing to do
is to be cynical and skeptical

377
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,730
and pick things apart.

378
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,720
>> I know that would never happen
in CS50, but you see that

379
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,990
amongst certain kind of
high IQ technical people.

380
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,670
And yet, optimism is a force multiplier.

381
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,920
So how are you brutally
realistic and be optimistic?

382
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,285
It's very, very important.

383
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:20,540

384
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
>> I figured this out after
a while at Microsoft.

385
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,680
Salespeople at Microsoft are naturally
optimistic, probably everywhere.

386
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,890
Just tell us where to
go and we're gonna run!

387
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,930
And I know we're gonna succeed!

388
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,200
Because people want to believe.

389
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,840
Engineers, you say, here's
where we're going to go,

390
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,180
and the first thing they
say is, oh, come on.

391
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:40,950
>> [LAUGHTER]

392
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,990
>> That's not right.

393
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,240
That's not the right way to go.

394
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,570
But I have found-- and this might
belie my fundamental optimism--

395
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,540
that the engineer's
optimist is sometimes

396
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,190
a little different than the salesman.

397
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,850
While the salesman just says, where to
go, charge, the engineer likes to say,

398
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:04,200
the world is all screwed
up, but I can fix it.

399
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,980
That's an engineer's optimism to me.

400
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,800
Everything's-- but I can fix it.

401
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,220
>> Luck-- this is the one
that really doesn't always

402
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,600
play well amongst Harvard guys.

403
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,590
It turns out that as smart as
you are, as privileged as you

404
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,310
are to be at a place like
this, and as hard as you work,

405
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,460
luck is still going to
be a factor in your life.

406
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,970
Whether you're Bill Gates, Mark
Zuckerberg, or the man in the moon,

407
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,740
luck is important.

408
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,110
It really is.

409
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,170
>> Why is that important to know?

410
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,610
Because it means you better
like what you're doing.

411
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,824
You better not be doing things just
because it will make you successful,

412
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:46,990
because you're going to need some luck
to make yourself as successful as you

413
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,300
want to be anyway.

414
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,880
So find something where
your passion wins out,

415
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,730
where you're really satisfied.

416
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:55,740
And then understand-- I know this.

417
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,280
>> I think I'm really talented guy.

418
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,500
I think Bill's a genius.

419
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,370
I think Paul Allen is
amazing, insightful guy.

420
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,410
And I say, boy, how lucky we were.

421
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,330
Apple-- I've seen
their success, and yet,

422
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,730
how lucky they were in many dimensions.

423
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,700
We're a company that
gave them $500 million

424
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,880
when they were almost bankrupt
in '97-- confluence of factors.

425
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,970
And then they did great things with it.

426
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,270
But luck always factors in.

427
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,120
>> And then last, but not least, because
I think I'm about out of time,

428
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,040
everything in the world-- and this
comes from a guy with a real bias--

429
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,960
everything is a technology problem.

430
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,780
Innovation and technology
is the heartbeat

431
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,610
that leads to progress in the world.

432
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,970
>> I read this book in the last six months.

433
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,060
It's called Inequality,
Capital in the 21st Century

434
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,100
by a French economist named Piketty.

435
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,120
It was kind of controversial.

436
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,490
It turns out, if you look
at the Amazon statistics,

437
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,670
hardly anybody finished the book.

438
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:57,510
It sort of reads like a
socialist diatribe in the end.

439
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,570
But it's got all this great
analysis in the beginning.

440
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,330
>> But a fundamental point
he makes, looking back

441
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,380
over thousands of years
of history, is GDP growth

442
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,370
is only a function of three things.

443
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,715
So the improvements
in life are a function

444
00:25:12,715 --> 00:25:17,980
of population growth and innovation.

445
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,990
That's it-- population
growth and innovation.

446
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,750
>> Today, the hot technology, the
operating system of all innovation,

447
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,520
is computer science.

448
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,690
And as I guess David likes
to say, I'm Steve Ballmer.

449
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,690
This is CS50, the most important
class you'll take at Harvard.

450
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,104
Thank you.

451
00:25:36,104 --> 00:25:39,548
>> [APPLAUSE]

452
00:25:39,548 --> 00:26:08,239

453
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:11,030
DAVID J. MALAN: So Steve has kindly
left an enormous amount of time

454
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:11,900
here to take questions.

455
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,170
We have two microphones here.

456
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,010
We have two microphones in the balcony.

457
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,280
So you are encouraged to meet
Gabe and Davin and others here

458
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,500
if you would like to be the first
and second to ask these questions.

459
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,000
STEVE BALLMER: Or you can shout out.

460
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,880
I've heard that's standard
protocol in this class.

461
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,090
>> DAVID J. MALAN: All the better.

462
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,390
>> STEVE BALLMER: That also works.

463
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:32,850

464
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,780
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Our first
question over by Gabe here.

465
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,510
>> AUDIENCE: What was it like
for you making that decision

466
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,405
to drop out and go to Microsoft?

467
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:45,010
Because obviously, there
was a lot of uncertainty.

468
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,680
>> STEVE BALLMER: OK.

469
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,570
It's 1980.

470
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,280
I'm at Stanford Business School
finishing up my first year.

471
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,340
Bill Gates calls as I'm trying to
decide what to do for a summer job.

472
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,520
He says, hey, look, how are things?

473
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,970
Yeah.

474
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,740
Yeah, oh, you're not finished yet.

475
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,730
Yeah.

476
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,690
Too bad you don't have a twin.

477
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,040
We could kind of use a
business person around here.

478
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,663
That was the pitch.

479
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:15,130
>> [LAUGHTER]

480
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,050
>> I thought about it, and
I said, well, shoot.

481
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,710
I guess I could tell him.

482
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:23,515
So I called him back the next day
and said, well, maybe we talk.

483
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:25,270
We should talk.

484
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,350
And my instincts were actually right.

485
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,140
The most risk-free
decision you'll ever make

486
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,360
is the decision to drop out of college.

487
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,070
No, why?

488
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,650
I say it for a reason.

489
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,150
>> Colleges let you drop back in.

490
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,650
All my friends, professors--
oh, you're not gonna do that.

491
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:47,360
You're gonna go to work for McKinney
or blah blah blah-- I can't remember

492
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,740
who I had offers from--
Brownstone Consulting Group.

493
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,550
>> [LAUGHTER]

494
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,336
>> And I said, I might go join this friend
of mine who's got this small start up.

495
00:27:56,336 --> 00:27:58,050
Well, what do you know about that place?

496
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:02,270
And I said, it's the world leader
in something called software.

497
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:07,600
And I had written a couple programs, but
it's not like I-- I did not take CS50.

498
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,470
The only programs I had written was
for AM115 or something like that.

499
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,690
It was a mathematical modeling class.

500
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,380
>> And they looked at me kind of funny.

501
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,050
And I told my mom and dad.

502
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,342
My dad was an immigrant.

503
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:20,550
My dad did not go to college.

504
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,660
My mom did not go to college.

505
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,040
My dad was an immigrant
from Switzerland.

506
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,950
The only college he really grew
up hearing about was Harvard.

507
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,950
Even when I went to
Stanford to Business School,

508
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,520
he was afraid I was making
a mistake, because it

509
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,214
was some place unheard of to him.

510
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,630
And I said, I'm going to drop out.

511
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,250
And this company is the world leader
in software for personal computers.

512
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,440
And my dad said to me, what's software?

513
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,500
Well, that was not an
ignorant question in 1980.

514
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,170
It would seem funny now.

515
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,000
>> And my mom asked me an even
more prescient question,

516
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,330
which is why would a person
ever need a computer?

517
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,720
Because remember, we're in a
time of room-sized computers.

518
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,630
But I said, look.

519
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,440
I made a deal with Bill that said
if it didn't work, he could fire me

520
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,460
or I could drop back into
Stanford at the end of the summer.

521
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,760
>> After a month, I decided I'd made
a mistake going to Microsoft.

522
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,200
I was basically the bookkeeper
for a 30-person company.

523
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,890
I told Bill we were 30 people.

524
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,270
We needed to add 18.

525
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,490
He said, you're gonna
bankrupt this place, Steve.

526
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,710
I didn't ask you to drop out of
Stanford to bankrupt Microsoft.

527
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:29,610
>> And we had a huge fight.

528
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,178
We were good at that.

529
00:29:31,178 --> 00:29:32,522
>> [LAUGHTER]

530
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:33,897
>> And then he said, come on.

531
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,480
We're going out to dinner with my dad.

532
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,300
Bill's dad's sort of a scary looking
dude-- not really, but he's 6'7".

533
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,780
6'7" doesn't look that
tall anymore either to me,

534
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,170
but that's a Clipper thing.

535
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:52,130
>> But anyway, I went through my
shtick for Bill and his dad.

536
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:57,650
And that's where Bill invented what I
think was the theme for the company.

537
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,420
He said, you don't get it, Steve.

538
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,390
We're going to put a computer
on every desk and in every home.

539
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,820
>> And I settled down.

540
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,050
I stayed.

541
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,680
Stanford would still take me back.

542
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,170
It turns out, to this day,
I could go finish my MBA.

543
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,570
It just isn't that risky a proposition,
because these great schools

544
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:19,685
let you take time off as opposed
to drop out of their memory banks.

545
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:24,420
It turns out, I'm still a Stanford alum,
too, when it comes to alumni giving.

546
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,340
>> [LAUGHTER]

547
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,300
>> [APPLAUSE]

548
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,750

549
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,020
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Another question
from Ian at the mic here.

550
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,270
>> AUDIENCE: So you've made a series
of comments about net neutrality,

551
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,880
particularly speaking against
it, most recently in a tweet.

552
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,040
And that's a particularly
unpopular opinion

553
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,284
amongst a lot of young
people and tech people,

554
00:30:48,284 --> 00:30:50,200
so I was wondering if
you could elaborate that

555
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,690
in maybe more than 180 characters.

556
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,680
>> STEVE BALLMER: Yeah.

557
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,180
Well, first, I haven't
made a lot of comments.

558
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,360
I made one little tweet
yesterday, because I

559
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,550
was kind of annoying on the
plane and had nothing to do.

560
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,645
So I tweeted.

561
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:07,940
And boy, did that tweet get more
attention than I ever expected.

562
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,510
>> But look, I can explain.

563
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,880
What is net neutrality about?

564
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,700
I'm not quite sure.

565
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:21,810
But it's not necessarily about keeping
down the price of internet access.

566
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:26,160
Competition keeps down the
price of internet access.

567
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:31,580
Net neutrality is merely
deciding who's going to pay.

568
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,080
If the providers who are making
money on the internet-- the Googles,

569
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,880
the Netflixes-- the
Clippers, for example,

570
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,220
if we were to go over the top
with the Clippers broadcast,

571
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,880
we too would be a
broadband content provider.

572
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,250
We're looking at that at the Clippers.

573
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,350
>> But by saying you can't differentially
charge for the traffic, what it says

574
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:55,960
is all consumers should
pay a higher price

575
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,830
for the people who need the
services that actually cost more.

576
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,910
So if you watch Netflix,
there's two approaches.

577
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:09,330
You can tell your neighbor who
doesn't watch Netflix, ha, ha, ha, ha.

578
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,160
You pay more, even though you
don't watch Netflix, than I do.

579
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,490
Or you can let the market
compete in differentially priced.

580
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,340
>> I think we're going to get
better service, more pricing

581
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,810
options, and a better overall
deal by having competition

582
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,800
between broadband providers
than by regulating the price.

583
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,210
So this, to me, is not about
low prices versus high prices.

584
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,760
It's about letting free enterprise
solve the problem versus thinking

585
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,250
a few thinkers in DC can invent
complicated pricing and tariffing

586
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:50,150
schemes that are superior in
creating opportunity than the market.

587
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:55,050
>> Ultimately, what we really want is more
investment in broadband infrastructure

588
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:58,310
that leads to better
service at lower prices.

589
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,390
I'm with you on that.

590
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,470
I'm 100% in on that.

591
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:06,090
I'm making a statement in terms of how I
think the world will best achieve that.

592
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,669
And I feel clear in my
thinking about that.

593
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,710
DAVID J. MALAN: Up next,
our microphone by Anton.

594
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,770
STEVE BALLMER: And I'll say that
even though I know we probably

595
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,700
will wind up-- if we go over the
top with our Clippers TV broadcast,

596
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,170
we will wind up paying more
and our customers will pay more

597
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,810
and we will make a little less
profit, but everybody else

598
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,380
will get lower prices for
fundamental broadband access.

599
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,679

600
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,970
AUDIENCE: Thanks for your time.

601
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,969
What do you love most
about owning the Clippers?

602
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,250
Who's-- wave your hand so--

603
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,374
>> AUDIENCE: Up here.

604
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:38,290
STEVE BALLMER: Oh, hi.

605
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,415
AUDIENCE: What's up, Steve?

606
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:42,161
STEVE BALLMER: It seemed like God.

607
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:42,660
Go ahead.

608
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,120
>> AUDIENCE: Voice of a deity.

609
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,350
>> STEVE BALLMER: What do I like
best about owning the Clippers?

610
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,030
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

611
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,196
>> STEVE BALLMER: I don't know.

612
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:51,120
Three months in, I can find the
bathrooms now in the stadium.

613
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,110
That's my level of sophistication.

614
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,870
There's a lot of things
that have been fun.

615
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,740
It turns out it's even more fun
to think about the team dynamics

616
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,000
and hear about those from
the coach than I thought.

617
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,930
>> Worrying about the fan
experience in the arena--

618
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:11,212
I didn't-- the song you were
playing before this started,

619
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:13,670
I don't know the name, but I
need to get the name from you.

620
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,489
I was thinking, that's a great song.

621
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:19,940
We could really use that song for
pump ups coming out at time outs.

622
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,250
>> [LAUGHTER]

623
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,389
>> No, seriously.

624
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,989
You could say it's my-- I still am
I a "We Will Rock You" kind of guy.

625
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:32,260
But we have 150 possessions
in a basketball game.

626
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,780
And let's say at least
on half of them, we

627
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,860
want to do something to
keep the crowd engaged.

628
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,090
How do you do that?

629
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:41,070
How do you orchestrate that
kind of busy environment?

630
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,060
What do you want to do on the Jumbotron?

631
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,820
>> The technology in
basketball-- unbelievable.

632
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,340
Every MBA arena now has
six cameras in the ceiling

633
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,340
that are taking pictures of the action.

634
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,870
And there actually are start ups that
have machine learning technology that

635
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,700
looks at the video and
characterizes the action

636
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,870
so it uses computers to decide that
was a pick and roll versus a pick

637
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:07,160
and pop with Chris
Paul and Blake Griffin.

638
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,320
That was a blitz by Jamal Crawford.

639
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,330
And every arena is equipped
with this technology.

640
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,530
>> And literally-- it's a company
called Second Spectrum.

641
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:23,200
And one of the key guys is a 6'9" hooper
out of MIT who never played basketball

642
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,050
after college, but he's doing machine
learning algorithms across vision

643
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,200
recognition on basketball stuff.

644
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,530
That's been kind of fun.

645
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:36,080
The in arena, thinking about
going over the top and what

646
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,810
do the economics look
like-- it turns out

647
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:41,970
there's a lot of pretty cool things.

648
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,730
>> It's much more complicated
business than it is large.

649
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,390
Microsoft, we have 100,000 people.

650
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,830
We got about 130 at the Clippers.

651
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:55,900
And yet, the breadth of problems we
get to think about is actually-- well,

652
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:59,020
it's not 1,000 times less complicated.

653
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,970
It's probably 500 times less
complicated than Microsoft.

654
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,962
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Next question
from Gabe's mic here.

655
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:07,670
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

656
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,671
My name is Larson Ishii.

657
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:11,586
I write for Clips Nation, so I was
going to continue with the Clippers

658
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,210
questions.

659
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:17,200
But I was going to ask about how you're
incorporating the rest of technology.

660
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,600
I've seen that you guys have an
increased proportion of statistics

661
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,240
within games, such as
showing the four factors that

662
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,245
produce the probability of victory
within the game, which I don't think

663
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:30,020
any other teams are doing in the league
currently, which is really awesome.

664
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,450
>> So I just want to know how,
from your math background,

665
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,420
you're incorporating more of the
technology and statistical side

666
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,760
into the game of basketball in what
is scene as more than emerging field,

667
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,015
and if that can help solve the Clippers'
small forward problem right now.

668
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:48,640
STEVE BALLMER: With a little edge
in the end of that question--

669
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,480
[LAUGHTER]

670
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,310
What we're doing right noq--
and the tech is just not quite

671
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:00,110
there-- is for every
game, we produce a couple

672
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,670
of plays that actually take some
key play from last time we played

673
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,360
an opponent, and it shows
statistically what the probability was

674
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,130
of success and the
expected points, depending

675
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,276
upon the decisions the player makes.

676
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:14,650
So you see the guys on the court.

677
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,650
Chris is with the ball.

678
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,850
If he throws it to Blake
Griffin, 30% chance.

679
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,420
On this one, he'd have a 40% chance of
making a basket with an expected two

680
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,310
point or three shot point shot.

681
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,890
And we're using that to demonstrate.

682
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,060
>> What you want to do, of course,
is get it so comes back real time.

683
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,790
So we can take a play that just
happened and have the visualization

684
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:38,760
based upon the data that's coming out
of the sensors happen in real time

685
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,570
so fans can really track just how
amazing the speed and the decision

686
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,350
making at that speed is.

687
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,092
>> But we're working our way up to that.

688
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:50,550
The thing that we've done that
actually gets a lot interest

689
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,720
is the thing we call our
Clipper Tron application.

690
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,940
You just go to www.clippertron.com
while you're sitting in the arena,

691
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,740
and you can pick your favorite player.

692
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,465
You can pick a kind of a play-- a pick
and roll, a blitz, a this and this.

693
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:08,214
And we'll go throw the
highlight up on the Jumbotron.

694
00:38:08,214 --> 00:38:10,380
We're adding, now, Twitter
and Facebook integration.

695
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,245
So we put your name.

696
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,610
We'll put your picture.

697
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,090
And we'll put the plays
that you picked and we can--

698
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,470
people love seeing themselves
on the Jumbo-- kiss

699
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,570
cam, all that kind of stuff.

700
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,510
>> At least, now, we're letting
people throw up basketball action.

701
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,885
Eventually, I want to be able
to do it in people's homes.

702
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,740
So with your phone,
you go to Clipper Tron,

703
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,890
and we'll throw it up live
in the broadcast to you

704
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,620
on TV-- so some of the
stuff we're playing with.

705
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,020
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Another
mic up by Dan Bradley.

706
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,550
>> AUDIENCE: Steve, after his
contract with the Lakers is up,

707
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:45,420
would you consider signing Jeremy
Lin as a backup for Chris Paul?

708
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,910
>> STEVE BALLMER: I support Doc
Rivers 100% in his decision

709
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,770
making about our basketball team.

710
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:56,320
My job is to support, ask a
lot of questions, and support.

711
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,220
How's that for not
answering your question?

712
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,705
>> [LAUGHTER]

713
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,685
>> [APPLAUSE]

714
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:05,160

715
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,620
>> I did go to the Laker-Clipper game
in LA last week, week before last.

716
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,440
I'm pleased to report two things.

717
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,010
One, Jeremy Lin played well.

718
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,920
And two, we kicked them.

719
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:24,542

720
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:25,561
>> AUDIENCE: So I'm Bobby.

721
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:28,060
I'm from LA, just in case you
guys need interns this summer.

722
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,935
No, I'm just kidding.

723
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:29,700
[LAUGHTER]

724
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,330
>> But seriously--

725
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,160
>> STEVE BALLMER: Bobby,
sballmer@clippers.com,

726
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,080
in case you need an
internship this summer.

727
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,660
>> [LAUGHTER]

728
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,510
>> Luck, opportunity, take advantage of it.

729
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,050
You got to feed the aggressive instinct.

730
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:43,720
Go ahead, Bobby.

731
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,940
Run with it, though, babe.

732
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,110
>> AUDIENCE: So you mentioned your
33 on your first exam or whatever.

733
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,790
But can you tell us more about other
examples of failure in your career

734
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,540
at Microsoft or in your life
and what you've learned from it

735
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,037
and how you responded, et cetera?

736
00:39:56,037 --> 00:39:56,870
STEVE BALLMER: Yeah.

737
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,900
I'm funny.

738
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:05,290
I don't actually-- it turns out, I
got a B plus on the test with the 33,

739
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,980
because it was the fifth
highest grade in the class.

740
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,090
Although I do to play golf with a guy in
LA who reminds me he got 50 on the test

741
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,185
and beat me.

742
00:40:15,185 --> 00:40:17,280
He remembers that to this day.

743
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,030
>> So everything's relative.

744
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:26,270
I'm a guy who's so optimistic,
in a way, I never think I fail.

745
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,440
I just haven't succeeded yet.

746
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,700
I say be first, but commit to be last.

747
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,200
OK.

748
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,910
Well, that's not going well.

749
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:38,640
And you can see it in
Microsoft behavior.

750
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,870
People used to say we don't get
things right till version three.

751
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,110
I don't know whether to take
that as a criticism or praise.

752
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,170
Get it right early is good, but
commit to getting things right.

753
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:54,680
>> So I've certainly had setbacks,
whether it was at school.

754
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Certainly, when we and
IBM split ways, I thought

755
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,840
our company would probably
go out of business.

756
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,990
That was about 1990.

757
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:05,280
Certainly, I've been told
many times that we'd never

758
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,560
succeed in the enterprise business.

759
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,100
I was told that you can't
do a start up video game.

760
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:14,960
>> I was told no search engine
will ever succeed versus Google.

761
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,457
There's still more of an element
of truth to that one than I'd like.

762
00:41:18,457 --> 00:41:19,650
>> [LAUGHTER]

763
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,600
>> I was told that the mobile device market
is locked up, which I don't believe.

764
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,990
It's partly because I believe in the
power of innovation and the power

765
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,960
not only for people to change
and improve themselves,

766
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,790
but that things do change over time.

767
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:37,175
And as long as you're prepared,
as I said in my talk--

768
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:39,800
if you've been in the weight room
and you have the capabilities

769
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,920
and skills to do something
and you stay in the game,

770
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,010
then you're prepared to take
and seize on the next idea.

771
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,293
>> It's kind of like saying, hey, look,
we don't know how to beat the-- I

772
00:41:51,293 --> 00:41:52,209
won't take basketball.

773
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,490
I'll take football.

774
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:56,490
People don't know how to beat
the Patriots or the Seahawks.

775
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:01,060
But that doesn't mean you don't stop
training, working out, building skills.

776
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,510
You keep working on your
game plan, but you're always

777
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,440
building your skills and capabilities.

778
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,996
Then you can be optimistic that failure
will lead to success the next time.

779
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:12,370
DAVID J. MALAN: Why don't we
take a couple more questions

780
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,120
and leave some time
for hellos at the end?

781
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,872
Belinda?

782
00:42:15,872 --> 00:42:17,580
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks
so much for coming.

783
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,120
So I really appreciated a
lot of the things you said,

784
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,940
and I think three things in
specific really resonated with me.

785
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,450
One, treasure your time.

786
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,650
Two, see the field.

787
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,010
And three, also explore your passions.

788
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,040
>> So the way I see it, the problem
is that time is so finite

789
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,190
and that we have such limited time.

790
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:39,650
And explore your passions
seems to me more depth-based,

791
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:41,630
whereas seeing the field
is very breadth-based.

792
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:44,967
So taken in the context of
also acquiring new skills,

793
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:46,300
how do you prioritize your time?

794
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,540
And specifically for you, when you said
you created a budget for your time,

795
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,710
how did you decide what was important
and what would be worth your time,

796
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,740
basically?

797
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,520
>> STEVE BALLMER: OK.

798
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:59,070
Let Two stories-- let me start
as an undergraduate at Harvard.

799
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:04,880
I beg every senior I know do what I did,
because I thought it really worked out.

800
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,670
When I was a senior, I interviewed
with 35 different companies on campus.

801
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,480
>> I'm trying to get my son to do that.

802
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,470
He's a senior.

803
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:15,700
I've tried to get friends
of mine whose kids went

804
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,490
to Harvard-- people don't do that.

805
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,470
But why was that good?

806
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:24,570
And then I got a chance to
sniff 35 different companies, 35

807
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,050
different cultures.

808
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,430
I went back and visited.

809
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:31,419
I can tell you what it felt like to run
a check processing room at Mellon Bank.

810
00:43:31,419 --> 00:43:33,210
I can tell you what it
would have felt like

811
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,369
to go to Minot, North Dakota
and trade grain for Cargill.

812
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:38,160
I can tell you what it
would have felt like

813
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,600
to run a small start
up insurance company

814
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,260
in Cleveland-- Progressive
Insurance, which is now,

815
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,230
of course, a major player.

816
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,760
I remember all these visits.

817
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,110
And I just think if you
want to see the field,

818
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:55,360
you have opportunities
to get what I would

819
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,220
call rapid little experiences that
are really helpful before you get down

820
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,990
to your passions.

821
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,940
>> What I would say as a CEO I did
is I blocked two kinds of time.

822
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,570
One was time that I would do whatever
our people in a given country

823
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:16,980
wanted me to do or our engineers in a
given product group wanted me to do.

824
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,730
That means they're
telling me about things

825
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,740
I'm not necessarily interested in.

826
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,020
But I can always help the
sales rep with a sale.

827
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,880
Hey, the boss is here, blah blah blah.

828
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,120
But I'm learning, learning,
learning, learning.

829
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,610
>> And then I also blocked explicitly
about call it a total of 20% of my time

830
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:36,730
where people couldn't schedule it.

831
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:40,130
And then I could use it
for reading, exploring.

832
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:43,550
But even time to explore
needs to be blocked.

833
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,790
And time to let others educate
you needs to be blocked.

834
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,310
>> And I think that's part of how
you can continue to see the field

835
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:56,900
and then develop the kind of
passion-- so just a few thoughts.

836
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,790
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Last
question from Davin's mic.

837
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,460
>> AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm J. Paul Meyer.

838
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,104
Over your years at Microsoft,
what product or hire

839
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:09,020
or whatever it is have you been most
excited about or you most excited

840
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,390
about?

841
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:14,810
>> STEVE BALLMER: It's kind of like asking
which of your kids you like the best.

842
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,260
And it's kind of situational, timewise.

843
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,650
You look at Windows 1.0 when it came
out-- I can't write a line of code,

844
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,080
but I was the development
manager for Windows 1.0.

845
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:31,910
Of course that's my favorite
product, and at the end of the day,

846
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,040
it's the backbone of Microsoft.

847
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:37,250
>> On the other hand, when you
say slick and interesting,

848
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,740
I'd probably point to Excel.

849
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,510
Life changing for me, I'd
probably point to Surface Pro

850
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,550
3 and the pen and One Note.

851
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:50,090
I finally have the thing I
really want to get my work done.

852
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,670
I really can be paperless.

853
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,330
I really have my life in the cloud.

854
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,550
>> For me, inking is very
important, because if you're

855
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,100
the guy somebody's presenting
to, you can't sit there and type.

856
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,470
If you want to draw and
annotate, markup, you can't type.

857
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:05,790
So I might say Surface Pro 3.

858
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:10,660
If I was home with my family, because I
have three boys of about the right age,

859
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,620
I'd say, well, of course, it
was Xbox 360 and the Halo game.

860
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:20,010
My 15-year-old still believes that's
the only worthwhile piece of work

861
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,600
I did in my working career.

862
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,924
>> [LAUGHTER]

863
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:27,340
Three weeks ago, he says to
me, Dad, I'm very disappointed

864
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:30,070
in you leaving Microsoft.

865
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:32,070
I was worried about this.

866
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,050
Aaron.

867
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,650
I don't know whether you can still get
me the new Halos when they come out.

868
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:37,810
>> [LAUGHTER]

869
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:40,630
>> So beauty's a little in
the eye of the beholder,

870
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,740
but I'd probably point to the
Surface Pro 3 in modern days

871
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:46,641
and Windows 1.0 in historic days.

872
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:49,140
DAVID J. MALAN: Well, let me
wrap up with a little something

873
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,540
we've never done before.

874
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,940
But we, on behalf of
CS50 TFs and TAs would

875
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,810
like to make you an honorary member
of CS50's staff if you'll have us.

876
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:59,766
>> STEVE BALLMER: OK, absolutely.

877
00:46:59,766 --> 00:47:01,722
>> [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

878
00:47:01,722 --> 00:47:04,645

879
00:47:04,645 --> 00:47:05,145
Nice!

880
00:47:05,145 --> 00:47:10,035

881
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:13,440
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And for everyone
here, you are all cordially

882
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,300
invited to a special event that
President Drew Faust, Dean Cherry

883
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,590
Murray, and Steve Ballmer
will be hosting tomorrow

884
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:21,944
at the I-Lab at 12:00 PM, for which
there will be a puzzle hunt which

885
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:24,360
is inside of this packet which
you'll be handed on the way

886
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,550
out, for which there's fabulous
prizes, including several Xboxes

887
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:30,035
and also a pair of Clipper tickets.

888
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:35,600
>> STEVE BALLMER: Clipper/Celtic tickets
for the game here on March 29,

889
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,590
visiting owners seats.

890
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,366
Do compete.

891
00:47:39,366 --> 00:47:39,866
[CHEERING]

892
00:47:39,866 --> 00:47:41,794
STEVE BALLMER: Thanks, everybody.

893
00:47:41,794 --> 00:47:44,204
DAVID J. MALAN: CS50,
this was Steve Ballmer.

894
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:51,180

895
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:55,310
>> STEVE BALLMER: This is CS50!

896
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,504
