00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,710
>> [APPLAUSE]

4
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,700

5
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,669
>> DAVID J. MALAN: This is CS50,
Harvard University's introduction

6
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,370
to the intellectual
enterprises of computer science

7
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,180
and the art of programming.

8
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,530
Now if you are among those that
every year are sitting here

9
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,450
with a bit of nerves in your mind, such
that you don't think you belong here,

10
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,270
you think that most
anyone sitting around you

11
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,730
knows far more than you, is indeed
more comfortable than you at computer

12
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,430
science or computers
more generally, realize

13
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,140
that 78% of the students who now
take CS50 have no prior experience.

14
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,570
>> Indeed, there's 100 dots there
on the display, 78 of which

15
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,540
are solid green, which means you,
if you're among that demographic,

16
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,420
are in very good company here on out.

17
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,320
And if you are instead among the
22% of CS50 students who do indeed

18
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,920
have prior experience, whether in
high school or some other program,

19
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,430
realize that you, too, will
be challenged in the course.

20
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,930
>> Not only do we have different tracks
for students less comfortable and more

21
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,789
comfortable alike in sections, we
also have so-called hacker editions

22
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,080
of most problem sets that
will challenge those students

23
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,650
with that additional experience
to explore similar material

24
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,140
but from a more
sophisticated perspective.

25
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,900
>> But what is computer science?

26
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,750
Well, ultimately, what's going to
matter as you explore this field is not

27
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,500
so much where you end up
relative to your classmates,

28
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,350
but where you yourself end up in
week 12 versus where you begin here

29
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,720
in week zero.

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,850
Now computer science-- well, let's
call it the science of computation--

31
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,910
where computation is really just a
fancy way of saying, taking some input,

32
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,460
producing some output, and
doing so by running algorithms,

33
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,700
sets of instructions for solving
some problem on those inputs

34
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,460
in order to produce some output or
solution in which you are interested.

35
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,310
>> So we recently had
occasion to travel out

36
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,170
to California to meet with an alumna.

37
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,650
Her name is Susan Wojcicki.

38
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,190
And she'd like to speak
to you here on video

39
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,690
to testify to just how applicable
even just a taste of computer

40
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,770
science at the
introductory level can be.

41
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,870
Even if you don't go on to pursue
computer science as a field,

42
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,330
or even engineering,
or STEM more generally,

43
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,360
you'll see, in fact, how a certain
course so influenced her life.

44
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,630
And she only just took it when she
was a senior here at Harvard College.

45
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,482
>> If we could dim the lights for Susan.

46
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:20,690
SUSAN WOJCICKI: Hello, world.

47
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm Susan Wojcicki.

48
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,110
I'm the CEO of YouTube.

49
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,150
And I took CS50 when I was
a senior at Harvard in 1990.

50
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,220
I was actually a history
and literature major.

51
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,760
>> And my junior summer,
I realized that maybe I

52
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,060
wanted to learn something
about computers.

53
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,930
And so, I came back.

54
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,500
I took CS50.

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,940
It was hard, but it was the
most amazing class I took.

56
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,630
>> It changed how I think about everything.

57
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,810
And when I graduated from Harvard
in 1990, I went to Silicon Valley.

58
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,140
And I got a job.

59
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,150
And I've been working
in tech ever since.

60
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,650
DAVID J. MALAN: Now what Susan
didn't mention in this video,

61
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,340
that it was actually in her
garage that Google itself was

62
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,420
founded by Larry and Sergey.

63
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,169
>> Now we also reached out to our friends
at code.org, an organization that

64
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:13,460
over the past year has been
getting people particularly

65
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,520
excited about computer science
and programming, in particular.

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,590
But it's worth noting that programming
is not computer science per se.

67
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,090
Computer science is not programming.

68
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,560
Rather programming is just a
tool-- with which all of you

69
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,510
will be all too well
familiar by semester's end--

70
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,650
such that you can apply not
just to future courses in CS

71
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,670
but to whatever fields from whence
you're coming, in humanities,

72
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,090
social sciences, natural
science, or the like.

73
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,740
>> Indeed, allow a few other
alumni and their colleagues

74
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,400
to speak to the applicability
of the field that awaits.

75
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:52,340

76
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,350
>> BILL GATES: I was 13 when I
first got access to a computer.

77
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,485
>> JACK DORSEY: My parents
bought me a Macintosh in 1984

78
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,640
when I was eight-years-old.

79
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,990
>> MARK ZUCKERBERG: I was
in the sixth grade.

80
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,670
>> SPEAKER 1: I learned to code in college.

81
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,080
>> RUCHI SANGHVI: Freshman year, first
semester, Intro to Computer Science.

82
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,850
>> BILL GATES: I wrote a program
that played tic-tac-toe.

83
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,100
>> DREW HOUSTON: I think it was
pretty humble beginnings.

84
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,370
I think the first program
I wrote asked things like,

85
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,820
what's your favorite color?

86
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,696
Or how old are you?

87
00:06:18,696 --> 00:06:21,070
ELENA SILENOK: I first learned
how to make a green circle

88
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,670
and a red square appear on the screen.

89
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,420
GABE NEWELL: The first
time I actually had

90
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,360
something come up and say, hello, world.

91
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,710
And I made a computer do that.

92
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,850
It was just astonishing.

93
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,224
>> MARK ZUCKERBERG: Learning how
to program didn't start off

94
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:35,450
as wanting to learn
all of computer science

95
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,630
or trying to master this
discipline or anything like that.

96
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,591
It just started off because I
wanted to do this one simple thing.

97
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:44,340
I wanted to make something that
was fun for myself and my sisters.

98
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,399
>> And I wrote this little program.

99
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,440
And then basically just
added a little bit to it.

100
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,930
And then when I needed
to learn something new,

101
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,210
I looked it up, either in
a book or on the internet,

102
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,240
and then added a little bit to it.

103
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,300
>> DREW HOUSTON: It's really not unlike
playing an instrument or something

104
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,007
or playing a sport.

105
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:01,090
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

106
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,120
So let us now actually
dive in a little deeper.

107
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,430
What are these inputs and outputs
that we're talking about here?

108
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,110
>> So how about something simple?

109
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,120
You probably know, even if you have
no familiarity with computer science

110
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,570
whatsoever, that computers somehow use
and understands only zeros and ones.

111
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,500
But how can that possibly be given how
much today's desktops and laptops alike

112
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,280
can do?

113
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,310
>> The DNA of the day, the only
alphabet that they understand

114
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,410
is a zero or a one.

115
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,470
Well, consider this.

116
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,840
We, humans, tend to use the
decimal system. "Dec" meaning 10.

117
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,970
And that's 10 because we have
10 digits, 0 through nine.

118
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,180
>> Now computers, by contrast,
tend to use binary.

119
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,270
"Bi" meaning two.

120
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,560
So they tend to use only zero and one.

121
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,680
But it turns out, that even
just with zeros and ones, that

122
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,900
is a sufficiently large alphabet
with which to represent most

123
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,490
any piece of data you want,
whether it's a number,

124
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,100
whether it's a letter, whether it's
a graphic or video on the screen.

125
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,140
>> Consider, for instance, how we humans
typically interpret this number here.

126
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,010
This is just three
digits, one, two, three.

127
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:04,570
But we know this number
innately now as 123.

128
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,510
But why is that?

129
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,570
>> Well, if you think back
to perhaps grade school,

130
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,700
you probably were taught to think of
these numbers as being in columns,

131
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
where the one is in the hundreds
place, the two is in the tens place,

132
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,360
and the three is in the ones place.

133
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,790
Why is that actually useful?

134
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,665
Well, think about the
super simple arithmetic

135
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,219
that we all have been
doing for years now.

136
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:24,510
Effectively, if you've got
a one in the hundreds place,

137
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,610
you do the quick math 100
times 1 plus 10 times 2--

138
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,059
because two is in the tens
place-- plus 1 times 3--

139
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,830
because three is in the ones place.

140
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,039
So, of course, if we
actually multiply this out,

141
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,600
what we're really representing
with this pattern-- one

142
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:46,150
two three-- is 100 plus 20 plus
3, which, of course, is 123.

143
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:51,130
>> Now binary, and computers really,
fundamentally speak the same language

144
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:51,680
that we do.

145
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,400
They just have a smaller alphabet.

146
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,100
So computers only have zeros
and ones at their disposal.

147
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,500
So whereas we humans have essentially
powers of 10 in each of these places--

148
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,810
10 to the zero, 10 to the one, ten
to the two, giving you 110 and 100

149
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,700
respectively.

150
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,140
>> Because computers only have two values
they can understand, zero and one,

151
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,600
they have to use different values
in these columns, one, two, four.

152
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,480
And if we kept going, eight,
16, 32, 64, and so forth.

153
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,220
But the pattern and the
mentality is exactly the same.

154
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,340
>> So by this logic, anyone, how would
I go about representing the number

155
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,530
one in binary?

156
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,080
If you've never even thought about
this before, what's your gut say?

157
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,777
>> AUDIENCE: One.

158
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:34,610
DAVID J. MALAN: One.

159
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,660
Exactly.

160
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,100
We just need a one in the
ones place because the zeros

161
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,610
suffice to give us
neither a four nor a two.

162
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,440
So one times one equals one.

163
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,940
Now things get a little interesting.

164
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,830
If I want to represent in
binary the number two-- but,

165
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,790
again, even if you've never
spoken this language before,

166
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,680
how do we represent in binary
the value we humans know as two?

167
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,570
Zero one zero.

168
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,620
Just put the one in the
column that you want it.

169
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,560
>> Now it's getting pretty
easy probably now.

170
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,950
So if I want to represent three--
there is no three's column.

171
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,770
So, again, I can now add these values
together by putting a one here.

172
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,320
So 2 times 1 plus 1
times 1 is, of course, 3.

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,480
>> Now things get a little fun in
that the ones now become zeros.

174
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
And to represent four, I get this.

175
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,310
And if we increment slowly
here-- that would be five.

176
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,700
This would be six.

177
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,100
This would be seven.

178
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,310
>> But now I seem to have
run into a problem.

179
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,520
How might I go about representing
eight-- would be the next value.

180
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,900
Yeah, so we need a new bits.

181
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,899
And, indeed, if you've
heard this phrase before,

182
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,380
bits, that's just short for
binary digit, zero or one.

183
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,520
>> And so I happen to be representing
only three such bits here.

184
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,900
But if I had a way of storing not
three different bits, but four,

185
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,250
surely I could represent
eight, and then nine, and then

186
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,400
10, and even higher and higher.

187
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,140
>> But that then calls
into question how we can

188
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,540
go about representing these
things in the first place.

189
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,950
It's one thing to draw
them up here on a slide,

190
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,660
but how do you represent them
if you're a mechanical device?

191
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,390
What is a computer doing to
represent the inputs and outputs that

192
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,020
fundamentally define computation
at the end of the day?

193
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,090
>> Well, what about something
super simple like this?

194
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,200
It's just a light bulb.

195
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,460
And I can trigger this
light bulb to go on

196
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,920
by turning some electricity
on and allowing electrons

197
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,585
to flow through, which changes its
state or its value, so to speak.

198
00:11:22,585 --> 00:11:24,460
For instance, this is
an old school desk lamp

199
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,250
here with one such
light bulb inside of it.

200
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,940
And right now it's not
really doing anything useful.

201
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,680
But as soon as I plug it
into an electrical socket

202
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,390
and then use this switch-- or
we can even call it a transistor

203
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,970
or think of it as such--
I can now represent either

204
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,120
this value, where the light bulb's
obviously off, or this value.

205
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,060
This value or this value.

206
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,520
This value and so forth.

207
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,220
>> So inside of a computer, presumably,
are much smaller pieces of hardware,

208
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,970
but that at the end
of the day simply have

209
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,360
to use electricity--
perhaps capture it--

210
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,730
and then either keep something
on or keep something off.

211
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,021
Of course, this isn't
particularly interesting to do

212
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,270
with just a single light bulb.

213
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,726
>> In fact, how high can I count in
binary with this desk lamp here?

214
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,420
>> AUDIENCE: One.

215
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,545
>> DAVID J. MALAN: One, right?

216
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:11,020
I need more desk lamps if I
actually want to count higher.

217
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,210
But we can do better than that.

218
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,460
Because the light bulbs that
we've put in these things

219
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,730
are actually fancier light bulbs
than yesteryear would allow.

220
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,310
And they're actually
networked light bulbs.

221
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,160
And bunches of companies
make these things these days.

222
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,190
>> But it turns out that
this one in particular

223
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,680
comes with a feature whereby
you can change its colors.

224
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,810
So for instance, if you
adorned your dorm room

225
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,200
with a few of these light
bulbs, depending on your mood,

226
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,366
depending on who comes in,
depending on the weather,

227
00:12:35,366 --> 00:12:37,360
depending on the time
of day, you can actually

228
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,300
change the colors of
the bulbs in your room.

229
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,740
And that's because these light
bulbs and others like it have what's

230
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,010
called an API, an application
programming interface, which

231
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,920
is a topic with which you'll be well
familiar with by semester's end.

232
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,710
>> And this is just a fancy,
cryptic way of saying,

233
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,570
you can program these light
bulbs to do your bidding.

234
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,360
You can send them messages
just like you, a human,

235
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,640
can send a message to a web server
saying, give me today's news

236
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,110
or give me my email.

237
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,010
>> You can send more arcane
messages to these light bulbs

238
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,700
to say, turn on and turn off.

239
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,370
But that's not all that interesting.

240
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,280
You can say, turn on red,
turn on green, turn on blue,

241
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,990
all with the same light bulb.

242
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,990
And you can even, with a bit more
savvy, say, turn yourself to blue

243
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,710
when it's a gloomy day
outside, for instance.

244
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,910
It can actually patch into
a weather API and find out

245
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,260
what the weather is, or the time
of day, or other such triggers.

246
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,550
>> So, in fact, two of
CS50's own staff members,

247
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,827
Dan Bradley and Ansel
Duff here, kindly procured

248
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:40,410
us a whole bunch of these light bulbs.

249
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,910
And they built CS50's
first ever binary bulbs,

250
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,850
where we've represented here--
with these playful little magnets--

251
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,780
the various placeholders we
alluded to just a bit ago.

252
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,572
>> So way over here is the
ones place, two, four.

253
00:13:52,572 --> 00:13:54,030
And we didn't see higher than that.

254
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,613
But, of course, they're powers of two.

255
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:59,490
Eight, 16, 32, 64, and 128.

256
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,320
So if I now want to be a little fancier
than using this old school switch,

257
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,310
I have here on this iPad
a super simple interface

258
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,440
that Dan Bradley, a former
student and now teaching fellow,

259
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,510
programed using some HTML
and JavaScript, which

260
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,685
are markup and programming
languages respectively.

261
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:17,560
And you can probably
see-- even in the back--

262
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,670
there's a big plus and a big minus,
plus one button for each of these bulbs.

263
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,740
And what this is going to allow me to
do is, for instance, click the plus

264
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,250
and now represent, of
course, what number?

265
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:28,750
One.

266
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,220
And I can hit it again.

267
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,480
Two.

268
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,800
Three.

269
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,950
Four.

270
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,200
Five.

271
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,360
Six.

272
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,880
Seven.

273
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,740
>> And here now we get that rollover,
but we have a fourth bit this time,

274
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,180
so now we have eight.

275
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,000
So we could do this for quite some time.

276
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,530
In fact, as an aside,
how high could we count?

277
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,318
Anyone?

278
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:49,270
>> AUDIENCE: 255.

279
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,420
>> DAVID J. MALAN: 255, right?

280
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,900
Don't worry too much about the math for
now, but that's a pretty decent number.

281
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,140
But it actually does bound just
how many pieces of information,

282
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,760
like a letter, or a graphic
that we could represent.

283
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,697
>> But no matter for now.

284
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:04,530
I'm going to go ahead
and turn them all off.

285
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,670
And if I could, I'd like to ask for
a volunteer, our first volunteer--

286
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,342
oh, hello-- on stage.

287
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,050
The catch is you have to be
comfortable appearing, as you clearly

288
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,421
are in front of all your classmates,
as well as on the internet.

289
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,420
And let me look a little beyond the--
how about here in the white shirt?

290
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,920
And hand up.

291
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,071
Come on up.

292
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:22,820
What is your name?

293
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,760
>> AUDIENCE: Jackie.

294
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,718
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Jackie.

295
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:25,820
Jackie, come on up.

296
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,820
So what there is also on this
iPad is a button called Game Mode.

297
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,570
And this Game Mode is
going to allow me to input

298
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,780
in advance a particular decimal
number, the numbers we humans are

299
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,760
familiar with.

300
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,820
And then you will be challenged
here to use the buttons

301
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,140
on the top-- one for
each of these bulbs--

302
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,050
to actually figure out
the pattern of light bulbs

303
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,970
that represents the number in question.

304
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:47,790
>> And I'm sorry, what was your name again?

305
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,250
>> AUDIENCE: Jackie.

306
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:48,620
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Jackie.

307
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:48,920
All right.

308
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,740
Good to meet you.

309
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,580
>> So let me go ahead and program in
for the world to see the number 15.

310
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,360
We'll keep it small at first here.

311
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,240
And I'm going to go into Game Mode.

312
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,160
And I'm going to specify,
give us the number 15.

313
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,900
>> OK.

314
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,510
And now with everyone watching-- if
you want to maybe stand this way,

315
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,970
because it will line up-- go ahead and
toggle the eight buttons along the top

316
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,530
to turn the bulbs on
or off as you see fit.

317
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,530
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

318
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:17,720
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And no cheating
by hitting plus 15 times.

319
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,275
Oh, we are going to do that.

320
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:20,069
>> AUDIENCE: Oh, wait.

321
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,610
I'm so sorry.

322
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,660
>> DAVID J. MALAN: You can also turn
the light bulbs on individually

323
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,076
with each of these buttons on top.

324
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:24,844
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

325
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:27,429
So it would be like--

326
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:28,220
DAVID J. MALAN: OK.

327
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,100
So now we have eight.

328
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,280
So let's pause for the
audience to engage here.

329
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,300
What number is Jackie
currently representing?

330
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,800
11.

331
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,730
So we're almost there.

332
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,360

333
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,630
And excellent.

334
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,487
So we have our first winner.

335
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:42,445
Congratulations.

336
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:48,200
>> And we thought we'd have
some fabulous giveaways.

337
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,860
If you'd like to be one such
dorm room here on campus,

338
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,126
you can yourself have a final project
using now this API, thanks to Jackie.

339
00:16:56,126 --> 00:16:57,050
So now--

340
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,902
>> [APPLAUSE]

341
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:01,690

342
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,839
>> --if we could, one more
such around of this.

343
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,690
Oh, now everyone wants some light bulbs.

344
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,790
For the so-called hacker edition,
we're going to ramp it up a-- oh,

345
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,770
yeah, noncommittal.

346
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,010
I think you're coming up now
if your hand's going down.

347
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,800
What is your name?

348
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,424
>> AUDIENCE: Alex.

349
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,440
DAVID J. MALAN: Alex, come on over here.

350
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:26,190
So for Alex, we are going to
program in a slightly larger number.

351
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,790
Perhaps in order.

352
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,110
The number 50.

353
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,744
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

354
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,660
DAVID J. MALAN: But, as
I said-- and you might

355
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,580
want to stand here so
that the buttons line up

356
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,115
as you would expect-- but I did
call this the hacker edition.

357
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:47,125
So-- good luck!

358
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:48,416
>> [LAUGHTER]

359
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:58,570

360
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,050
>> You will be able to turn
them off if you-- OK.

361
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:02,880
Excellent.

362
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,675
Wonderful.

363
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:04,341
Congratulations.

364
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:08,730
>> [APPLAUSE]

365
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,355
I suppose I should pay up.

366
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,830
Congratulations to Alex as well.

367
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,330
OK.

368
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,550
>> So the ultimate takeaway
here is hopefully, frankly,

369
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,109
the simplicity-- the
simplicity with which

370
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:20,650
you can get some nice light
bulbs, apparently in [INAUDIBLE].

371
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,000
But they represent,
ultimately, the same ideas

372
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,310
with which we humans are
already all too familiar.

373
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,660
So what might the next
step be in the progression

374
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,920
of trying to do something
interesting with data

375
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,950
and representing inputs that aren't just
numbers but are maybe letters or more?

376
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,820
>> Well, it turns out that the
computer world, for many years,

377
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:43,300
simply adopted an arbitrary but a
consistent standard that maps numbers

378
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,610
to letters of the alphabet.

379
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,120
For instance, here is an
excerpt from that mapping.

380
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,350
It's called Ascii.

381
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,220
A-S-C-I-I. And that is simply a
table that maps uppercase letters--

382
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,600
in this case-- to decimal numbers.

383
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,890
>> But what's the implication?

384
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,090
Well, if you actually want to represent
something like an email or some text

385
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,310
on a web page, you
obviously want to show

386
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,100
the human letters of the
alphabet, not numbers.

387
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,140
So depending on the
context of the program

388
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,600
that a user is using, if it's
a web browser or email client,

389
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,090
numbers can certainly be
interpreted as letters.

390
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,290
That is to say, patterns of bits can
easily be interpreted as letters.

391
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,700
>> And so what we can have
is the letter A being

392
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,410
represented as 65, B
being represented as 66.

393
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,900
So if we have a super
short word, like hi,

394
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,740
what a computer would ultimately
store in decimal but really in binary,

395
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,070
using some sequence of bits, leveraging
a bit of electricity in some way,

396
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,010
would be the two numbers 72 and 73.

397
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,780
>> But the pattern of bits that
represents those values.

398
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,820
So these then are how we can
represent our inputs and outputs.

399
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,630
And suffice it to say, we can
do more complex representations

400
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,450
ultimately with things like
graphics, videos, music, and more

401
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,190
as we'll see later this term.

402
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,630
>> So that just leaves then
algorithms, these sets

403
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,490
of instructions with which
we're solving actual problems.

404
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,820
We're passing in inputs to algorithms.

405
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,630
And those algorithms are producing
outputs, hopefully correct outputs

406
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,160
and hopefully, too,
efficiently gathered outputs.

407
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,890
In other words, it's one thing
to implement something correctly.

408
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,790
It's another thing to implement
something well or efficiently.

409
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,690
>> For instance, one demonstration
that we're fond of in the course

410
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,460
is this one.

411
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,345
But these things are getting
increasingly hard to find.

412
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:28,930
But this is indeed an old school
phone book, inside of which

413
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,580
are 1,000 plus pages of
names and telephone numbers.

414
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,830
And if I wanted to look up
someone in this phone book,

415
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,640
I could simply do a
very naive algorithm.

416
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,150
I could open up to the first page, and
I could start to look for, say, someone

417
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,130
named Mike Smith.

418
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,160
And if he's not on the first
page, I progress to the second,

419
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,120
and then to the third, and then
to the fourth, and so forth,

420
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,430
until I finally find Mike Smith.

421
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,010
>> Now is that algorithm correct?

422
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,896
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

423
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:54,248
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

424
00:20:54,248 --> 00:20:56,039
If he's in there, I'll
eventually find him.

425
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:58,820
But it's arguably not very
efficient, certainly not fast,

426
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,200
because, my god, why am I
wasting my time flipping

427
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,500
through all of these pages when I could
certainly do this physically faster?

428
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,210
>> Well, a slight optimization, so to
speak, might be not one page at a time,

429
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,610
but two, four, six, eight, 10.

430
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,725
Still correct?

431
00:21:12,725 --> 00:21:14,030
>> AUDIENCE: No.

432
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,040
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So no if I for
instance skip over Mike Smith.

433
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,530
But so long as I back pedal
one page, if I overshoot him,

434
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,240
maybe we could correct what
might otherwise be a gotcha.

435
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,020
>> But is it better?

436
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,469
Is it faster?

437
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:28,010
I mean, yeah.

438
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,950
It's literally twice as fast
if I do two pages at a time.

439
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:35,720
So if I originally had 1,000 pages,
now I only have to flip 500 times,

440
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,429
not fully 1,000 pages to get
potentially in the worst case

441
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,220
to the end of the phone
book, where someone

442
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,380
like Mike Smith or someone with
a later name might actually be.

443
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,540
>> But, of course, we
humans certainly aren't

444
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,250
going to be doing that, certainly
not at this point in our lives.

445
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,454
What is a reasonable
human likely going to do?

446
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:52,870
AUDIENCE: Go straight to the9 S's.

447
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,860
DAVID J. MALAN: Go straight to the S's?

448
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,563
How do I go straight to the S's?

449
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:57,342
>> AUDIENCE: Rip it in half.

450
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,050
DAVID J. MALAN: Well,
there's no marking.

451
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,116
So, yes, if there were indeed
a label or a sticky tab for S,

452
00:22:02,116 --> 00:22:03,240
we should jump right there.

453
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,420
But it's pretty innocuous.

454
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,480
So the best I can do is roughly
to the S section or maybe roughly

455
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,650
into the middle.

456
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,110
But the key takeaway
now-- and the intuition

457
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,430
that you've taken for
granted for years probably--

458
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:17,103
is that what do you now
know about this problem?

459
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,320
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

460
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,290
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Mike Smith is surely
not in this half of the problem

461
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,600
because Smith comes after the middle
which is roughly the M section,

462
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,510
it seems to be.

463
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:30,340
So as you might have seen at
Visitas, we can now literally

464
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,737
tear this problem in half.

465
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:32,320
AUDIENCE: Woo!

466
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,690
DAVID J. MALAN: It's
getting easier and easier.

467
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,666
[APPLAUSE]

468
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,618
There you go.

469
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:39,060
[LAUGHTER]

470
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,870
And now I fundamentally
have the same problem,

471
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,866
but it's literally half as big.

472
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:45,240
I'm still looking for Mike Smith.

473
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,950
And I daresay, I can still
look for him in the same way,

474
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,200
splitting the problem in half
again, tearing the problem again

475
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,140
in half, which now leaves me with
a problem a quarter of the size,

476
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,710
dramatically throw that half away, and
repeat this process again and again

477
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,150
and again, glancing down
at each point to see

478
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,400
if Mike Smith is on
the page in question.

479
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,190
>> Now if I do this right,
ultimately I'll find myself

480
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,085
with just one page on which Mike Smith
is if he's indeed in the phone book.

481
00:23:11,085 --> 00:23:13,510
Of course, I could
never call Mike again.

482
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,800
But the point here is that if we started
with 1,000 pages, my first algorithm,

483
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,620
flip the page, maybe 1,000 times--
definitely less because it's

484
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,430
an S name and not a Z name, but as
many as 1,000 pages potentially.

485
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,590
>> Second algorithm, better.

486
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,480
500 pages.

487
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,230
Third algorithm, though,
how many steps would it

488
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,520
take to divide a 1,000 page
phone book in half like that?

489
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,000
10, give or take.

490
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,770
So only by flipping through that
phone book, diving and conquering,

491
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:46,130
so to speak, 10 times, will I make
my way down to just one single page.

492
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,880
>> And so we can capture this intuition
now a little bit graphically

493
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,320
if you just consider
this super simple graph.

494
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,470
We're on the x-axis, or horizontal
axis, is the size of my problem,

495
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,100
the number of pages in the phone book.

496
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,040
And computer scientists
generally like to call

497
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,180
the size of a problem n, where
n is just some variable that

498
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,310
represents-- in this
case-- number of pages.

499
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,412
>> The vertical, or y-axis, here is
going to be the time to solve,

500
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,870
maybe the number of page turns,
maybe the number of seconds

501
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,960
or minutes, whatever
your unit of measure is.

502
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,337
And so this red line
represents the first algorithm,

503
00:24:14,337 --> 00:24:16,670
because there's a one to one
relationship between number

504
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,880
of pages and amount of time it takes.

505
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,240
>> If Verizon doubles the number of
pages in the phone book next year,

506
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,590
my running time-- the
time required to execute

507
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,610
that first algorithm--
doubles in the worst case.

508
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,690
But the second algorithm,
where I'm flipping by two,

509
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,650
requires less time for
a given size problem.

510
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,090
So if I have this many
pages here-- notice

511
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,870
that the yellow line
suggests less time to solve.

512
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:42,490
And indeed, it represents,
we'll say, n over two.

513
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:47,717
>> But what's the shape of the third
and final curve going to look like?

514
00:24:47,717 --> 00:24:50,800
Yeah, it's indeed going to look-- I
don't know what you were going to say.

515
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,300
But let's see what
you were going to say.

516
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,280
>> AUDIENCE: Like that.

517
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,060
>> DAVID J. MALAN: It's going to look like
this, a logarithmic slope-- exactly--

518
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,770
whereby you have this curious slope.

519
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:01,235
It's no longer a straight line.

520
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:05,000
And what's compelling about that is that
even though the graph is now cut off,

521
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,790
you can extrapolate in your
mind that that green line's not

522
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,060
going to increase in
height all that much

523
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:13,500
as you proceed further
down that horizontal axis.

524
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,890
>> Indeed, Verizon, for
instance, could double

525
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,100
the number of pages in the phone
book between this year and next year

526
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,140
from 1,000 to 2000
pages, but no big deal.

527
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,960
With this third and final,
there's a intuitive algorithm

528
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,209
of dividing and conquering.

529
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:29,000
It's going to take me how many more
steps next year to find someone

530
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,700
like Mike Smith?

531
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,560
>> AUDIENCE: One.

532
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,230
>> DAVID J. MALAN: There's just one.

533
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,430
And they can quadruple it, it's
going to take me just two more steps

534
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,210
and so forth.

535
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,730
And so this is testament to
just how some careful design

536
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,437
and some appreciation for what
your inputs are can do even better.

537
00:25:42,437 --> 00:25:44,270
Now we're cheating a
little bit in the sense

538
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,350
that we're leveraging an assumption.

539
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,500
What is my assumption
about our phone book

540
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,720
that allowed me to divide and conquer
in this intuitive and still correct way?

541
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,705
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

542
00:25:53,705 --> 00:25:54,580
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

543
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,440
So it was ordered.

544
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,392
It was alphabetized by
the phone book company.

545
00:25:57,392 --> 00:26:00,100
If it were in random order, that
would be a hell of a phone book,

546
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,850
but it certainly wouldn't
lend itself to the algorithm

547
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,950
I used, because you would never
just happen across Mike Smith

548
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,210
if you kept dividing in
half in that way by chance.

549
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,060
>> So let's now formalize
what's clearly intuitive.

550
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,950
So something called
pseudocode is where we'll

551
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,780
begin some of our initial problems.

552
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,410
And this is a generic way of describing
an algorithm or a computer program,

553
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,150
not using C, or C++, or Java,
or any specific language,

554
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,430
but just using English, with
which any human might be familiar.

555
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,220
>> And we might write the pseudocode
for this problem as follows.

556
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,520
Step one, pick up the phone book.

557
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,840
Step two, open to middle of phone book.

558
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,730
Step three, look at the names.

559
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,630
Step four, if Smith is among names--

560
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,960
>> And now this is an
interesting construct.

561
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,290
It's a decision point.

562
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,920
It's a fork in the road, if you
will, a branch, so to speak.

563
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,810
So I'm going to indent
just by convention step--

564
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,950
not five-- which is to
say, I'll call Mike.

565
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,290
So this indentation, totally
arbitrary human convention, but it's

566
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,160
simply meant to convey semantically
that if Smith is among names,

567
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,310
then I should call Mike.

568
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,630
>> Meanwhile in step six, notice
that the indentation's gone.

569
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,980
So else is the other fork in the
road, the other road I might travel.

570
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,130
So else if Smith is
earlier in the book, what's

571
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:16,964
my next step probably going to be here?

572
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:18,380
AUDIENCE: You go to the left side.

573
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,004
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, so go to
the left half of the phone book.

574
00:27:21,004 --> 00:27:24,140
Throw away the right half if
Smith is earlier in the book.

575
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,140
So open to the middle of
the left half of the book.

576
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,240
>> And then step eight, go to line three.

577
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,520
And this is a curious loop I'm
inducing, a recursion so to speak.

578
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,990
But more on that in the future.

579
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,590
>> I'm using my same algorithm,
my same pseudocode,

580
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,020
to solve the same problem again
because the only thing that's changed

581
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,550
is the size of the problem, not
my objective, and not the person

582
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,340
I'm looking for.

583
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,610
So I can reuse the algorithm
that I've already defined.

584
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,580
>> Else if Smith is later
in book-- you might

585
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,200
guess-- open to the middle of
the right half of the book.

586
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,350
And again, go to line three.

587
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,480
Else-- what's the final line
in this program going to be?

588
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,580
If he's not among the
names on the page I'm

589
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,870
on, if he's not earlier in
the book, and he's not later

590
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,899
in the book, what do I know
is true about Mike Smith now?

591
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:11,190
AUDIENCE: He's not in the book.

592
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,731
DAVID J. MALAN: He's not in the book.

593
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:16,040
So the best I can do is just
give up and stop this program.

594
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,540
All right.

595
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,350
So at this point, let's take a
quick tour of some of what awaits.

596
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,620
And in fact, I'm joined here
by a number of CS50 staff.

597
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,940
If these folks could all
join me up here on stage.

598
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,900
>> [APPLAUSE]

599
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:35,280

600
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,170
>> Mind you, this is only
a subset of CS50 staff,

601
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:42,380
since each year we have nearly 100 staff
members in roles of course assistants,

602
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,410
teaching fellows, and more.

603
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,700
Come on up.

604
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,820
So they will join us here
awkwardly for just a moment

605
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:54,230
as we give a whirlwind tour of what
you should expect here in the course.

606
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:59,640
>> So first and foremost, we have SAT/UNS
as the grading option in the course.

607
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,180
This is meant deliberately
to be an option whereby

608
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,570
if you are a bit uneasy
at being in the course,

609
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,390
and you do fear failure-- even if
frankly failure means hurting your GPA,

610
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,180
getting a B and not an A-- that is
precisely what, certainly for a gateway

611
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,750
course like CS50 and other
introductory courses,

612
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,540
this grading option is meant to allow.

613
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,930
>> I wholeheartedly encourage
students-- especially

614
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,090
if on the fence-- to start the
course SAT/UNS, even remain SAT/UNS.

615
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,310
But you can certainly switch to a letter
grade by the fifth Monday in the term.

616
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,560
>> Frankly, back when I
was a freshman in 1995,

617
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,630
I myself didn't even take CS50
because I didn't get up the nerve

618
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,540
to actually step foot in the classroom.

619
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,020
It seemed a domain far too
unfamiliar to me and really only

620
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,080
for those friends of mine,
frankly, who had been programming

621
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,570
since they were six-
or maybe 10-years-old.

622
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,640
And it was only because I was
able to take CS50 in my day

623
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,720
in the equivalent version of
SAT/UNS-- pass/fail back in the day--

624
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,850
that even I took 50.

625
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:57,440
And somehow or other, I'm
here again with you today.

626
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,690
>> Now meanwhile what else you
should keep in mind about 50

627
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,910
is simultaneous enrollment.

628
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,785
Contrary to rumors that
you might have heard,

629
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:07,650
you can, in fact, simultaneously
enroll in CS50 and another class that

630
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:12,150
meets at the same or some overlapping
time as CS50's lectures right here.

631
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:16,420
See the syllabus for the particulars
of the implementation thereof.

632
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,540
>> Lectures, meanwhile, contrary to
what's officially in the catalog,

633
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,060
will generally only
meet for just an hour.

634
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,240
On occasion we may run a little long.

635
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,800
But keep in mind that the
goal in CS50's lectures

636
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,980
is to provide you with
a conceptual overview,

637
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,830
hopefully some demonstrations,
maybe even some giveaways,

638
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,390
of what awaits for
the week that follows.

639
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,730
>> And so in lectures, we'll explore
those topics and examples together,

640
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:41,420
bringing students up on stage, and
staff up on stage as often as we can,

641
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,740
for just a couple of hours each week.

642
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,435
Sections, meanwhile, will be
offered by these folks here-- many

643
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:50,060
of them teaching fellows, some
of them course assistants-- will

644
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,160
be happening weekly.

645
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,940
>> And what's key to keep
in mind is that we

646
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,920
do have-- not unlike First
Nights, the music class--

647
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,220
different tracks of sections for
students less comfortable, more

648
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,150
comfortable, and somewhere in between.

649
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,559
And frankly, you know if
you're less comfortable.

650
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,600
And you probably know if
you're more comfortable.

651
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,920
And if you're not really sure, you are
by definition somewhere in between.

652
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,850
So when it comes time to section
in a week or so, per the syllabus,

653
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,070
we'll ask you that question.

654
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,890
And you can self-select based
on your own comfort level

655
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,220
and be with students-- be with green
dots-- similar in comfort level to you.

656
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,710
>> Meanwhile, we have problem
sets, which will ultimately

657
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,310
define your experience in this course.

658
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,370
They're offered typically
in multiple editions.

659
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,150
A standard edition that we expect most
every student in the course to tackle

660
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,900
but also a so-called hacker edition
that offers no form of extra credit

661
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,980
outright but really the bragging rights
to say that you tried and tackled

662
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,250
the course's hacker editions that
approach the similar material

663
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,370
but from a more sophisticated angle.

664
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,480
>> What we offer for the
standard edition, for,

665
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,420
again, a super majority
of students, are not

666
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:54,060
only walk-throughs, which are
videos led by the course's staff

667
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,840
that truly walk you through the
course's problems and possible design

668
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,910
implementations.

669
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,434
And we also, after the
fact, offer postmortems,

670
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:03,350
whereby if you're wondering
how you could have

671
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,930
or should have solved some
problem, the teaching staff

672
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,640
will walk you through
those on video as well.

673
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,350
>> Meanwhile, what awaits too are
five late days and the fact

674
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,680
that we will drop your
lowest problem set score.

675
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,370
We certainly appreciate that in exchange
for the workload that 50 expects

676
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:24,020
of you, life gets in the way
sometimes, if not five times.

677
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,150
And so this will offer
you a bit of flexibility,

678
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,400
extending your deadline from, say, a
Thursday at noon to a Friday at noon.

679
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,150
See the syllabus for the
implementation details thereof.

680
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,702
>> Now what now awaits?

681
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,660
And it's only occurring
to me now just how long

682
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,333
I'm having you guys stand here on stage.

683
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,060
>> [LAUGHTER]

684
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,867
>> DAVID J. MALAN: But we'll get to
the climactic finish before long.

685
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,700
So what awaits in terms
of the problem sets?

686
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,099
Well, perhaps a teaser of what we all
did last year with your predecessors.

687
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,140
In the first problem set
last year, we introduced

688
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,630
Scratch, a graphical
programming language that

689
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,570
lets you program literally by
dragging and dropping puzzle pieces,

690
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,220
like these, that are
reminiscent of the constructs

691
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,260
will see just one week
hence, when we switch

692
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,870
to a more traditional
language, known as C.

693
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,930
>> Last year we proceeded
to this problem set,

694
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,720
involving for cryptography,
the scrambling of information

695
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,410
to keep it from governmental or friends'
eyes that you don't want to see it.

696
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,540
Encoded in here is a
message that soon you

697
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,740
will be able to decrypt or de-scramble.

698
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,960
>> Breakout was a problem
set last year, wherein

699
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,530
you use these new found programming
skills to actually implement

700
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,840
a game wherein-- as you
may recall from childhood--

701
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,040
the goal was to bash the
bricks that are atop the screen

702
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,190
here, accumulating a
score along the way,

703
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:35,460
and implementing your own algorithms
with which this solution ultimately

704
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,357
lets you play the game.

705
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:39,440
Meanwhile, later in the
semester, we will give you

706
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,470
a dictionary of 143,091 English words.

707
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,300
And you will be challenged
to write a program that

708
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,260
spell checks, documents, by
loading that many words into memory

709
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,300
as efficiently as possible.

710
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,240
Generally pitting you
against your classmates

711
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,610
if you opt into a bit of a
challenge in leader board

712
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,090
to see who can use the fewest
seconds of running time,

713
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,550
and the fewest number
of megabytes of memory,

714
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:08,659
and actually fine-tuning your programs
to be incredibly resource efficient not

715
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,820
just time.

716
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,239
>> Last year, too, we looked at the end
of the semester at web programming.

717
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,230
And indeed, we'll do that again this
year with multiple problem sets,

718
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,290
introducing you to the techniques and
the mindset with which you can apply

719
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,489
these programming skills to
websites, dynamic websites,

720
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:26,639
websites that actually solve
problems and behave differently

721
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,620
and are not simply static
sites with static information.

722
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,854
>> The final project ultimately
will define, though,

723
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:34,770
the climax of the course
for students, wherein

724
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,228
you'll be challenged to implement
most anything of interest

725
00:34:37,228 --> 00:34:40,590
to you, so long as it somehow
draws upon the course's lessons.

726
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,930
>> And as you saw in the
video at the start,

727
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:47,340
we will conclude the semester with the
CS50 Hackathon, which if, unfamiliar,

728
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,420
will begin at 7:00 PM one night and
end at 7:00 AM the next morning.

729
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,614
Around 9:00 PM, we'll
order in first dinner.

730
00:34:53,614 --> 00:34:55,489
Around 1:00 AM, we'll
order in second dinner.

731
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,490
And if you're still
standing at 5:00 AM, we

732
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,320
will shuttle bus you
to IHOP for breakfast.

733
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,980
>> The CS50 Fair, meanwhile, is an event
to which 2,000 plus faculty, students,

734
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,850
and staff from across campus will
come to see your accomplishments

735
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:10,150
in the course and the final
projects and creations

736
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,960
that you create on your laptops,
desktops, or perhaps even light bulbs.

737
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,340
>> Meanwhile, office hours
and the support structure.

738
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,480
And now it would've been a
better time to bring you all up.

739
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,310
>> Office hours will take place four nights
a week for multiple hours each night

740
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,710
with generally 20 to 30 of the
course's staff on duty at once

741
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,240
to provide you with intimate
one-on-one opportunities for support

742
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,790
with the course's problem sets.

743
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,120
Tutoring too will be
available, particularly

744
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,630
for students less comfortable-- or
dare say least comfortable-- for whom

745
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,869
office hours are not the
most nurturing environment

746
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:43,660
and are certainly not
the most stress-free.

747
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,430
Especially when deadlines are pressing,
we will proactively pair you ourselves

748
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,440
with a member of the staff to work with
on some regular schedule as your needs

749
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,850
and their schedule allows.

750
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,260
>> And staff.

751
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:01,020
Allow me to introduce Davon, Rob,
and Gabriel, this year's heads.

752
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,370
If you would each like to say--

753
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,349
>> [APPLAUSE]

754
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,849
--a word.

755
00:36:03,849 --> 00:36:05,328
[APPLAUSE]

756
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:10,270

757
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,220
Davon over here is the
course's manager, which

758
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,730
means in his full-time role
he helps with the execution

759
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,424
and logistics of CS50.

760
00:36:18,424 --> 00:36:19,340
DAVON: Yeah, hi, guys.

761
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,965
You'll see a lot to me at office hours.

762
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,110
I'll be teaching sections.

763
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,150
And if you shoot emails ahead,
I'll probably be responding.

764
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:27,670
So I'll see lots of you all semester.

765
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,890
And welcome to CS50.

766
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:38,330
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And now Gabriel, who
himself was just a freshman last year,

767
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,820
but for the past couple of years has
been operating his own version of CS50

768
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,660
in Brazil, whereby he downloaded
all of the course's content--

769
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,890
which is clearly being
filmed and placed online--

770
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,480
so that he could translate it to
Portuguese and then teach more than 100

771
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,610
of his classmates over the
course of a couple of years,

772
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,650
teaching in his native tongue
the course's curriculum.

773
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,964
>> GABRIEL: Hello.

774
00:36:58,964 --> 00:37:00,912
>> [APPLAUSE]

775
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:06,669

776
00:37:06,669 --> 00:37:07,710
GABRIEL: Hi, I'm Gabriel.

777
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,340
I'm the head TF of the course.

778
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,780
And I hope you'll love CS50.

779
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,830
This is CS50.

780
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,697
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Now for Rob.

781
00:37:14,697 --> 00:37:15,780
Oh, you want introduction?

782
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,696
>> ROB: No, I don't know.

783
00:37:16,696 --> 00:37:18,225
[LAUGHTER]

784
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:19,475
DAVID J. MALAN: And Rob Boden.

785
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:22,300
[LAUGHTER]

786
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,800
ROB: Hi, I'm Rob.

787
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,220
This is my fifth year
involved with the course.

788
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
Every year, it's just a
better and better class,

789
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,550
so you guys are clearly
going to be awesome.

790
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,181
I hope you all have fun with it.

791
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:34,430
I'm going to have fun with it.

792
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,670
So see you around.

793
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,445
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And
time won't permit us--

794
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:39,670
>> [APPLAUSE]

795
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,661
>> Time won't permit us
to introduce everyone

796
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:44,660
on the stage and all of their colleagues
who are shopping classes today.

797
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,390
But allow me to introduce
Belinda and CS50 Puzzle

798
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,550
Day, which awaits this
coming Saturday, which

799
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,800
is the first of the
course's large scale events.

800
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,300
>> This one in particular meant
to hammer home the point

801
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,580
that computer science is ultimately
not about programming, but rather

802
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,280
about problem solving more generally.

803
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,450
And Puzzle Day, as you'll
see, will bring you

804
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,207
and your classmates together--
we hope this Saturday.

805
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:04,961
>> BELINDA: OK.

806
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:05,750
Hi, guys.

807
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,740
So thanks.

808
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,120
So as our illustrious captain
said, my name's Belinda.

809
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,100
I am a sophomore at Quincy House.

810
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,730
>> I, just like you guys, took
CS50 last year, really loved it.

811
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,960
I have a soft spot for
you guys in the third row.

812
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,384
And I'm proud to say, I'm now
in a committed relationship

813
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,300
with CS50 [INAUDIBLE].

814
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:22,799
OK.

815
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:26,140
That was my lame version of a joke.

816
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,320
>> Anyway, so moving on,
just wanted to invite

817
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,439
you guys all to the i-lab, or HBS hives.

818
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:33,730
We're going to be having
Puzzle Day from 12:00 to 3:00.

819
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,680
And it's a great opportunity for you
guys to meet your fellow CS friends,

820
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,780
solve some non-CS puzzles, like Captain
mentioned, and also eat some free food,

821
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,910
earn some awesome prizes, like
gift cards, $75 per person,

822
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,400
and also-- what was it?

823
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,540
Wii U or something?

824
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,333
Wii U?

825
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:51,040
Yes.

826
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,330
For our raffle.

827
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:52,830
Awesome.

828
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,310
So I'll stick around after class.

829
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,770
And if you guys have any
questions, let me know.

830
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,980
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And you'll see, beyond
this there's nothing to do today.

831
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,920
The first problem set
will go out Friday.

832
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,420
But to bring us home today, I'd like to
introduce you to specifically one more

833
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,080
member of the staff, Colton
Ogden here, whose hands are now

834
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,250
protected above you with
this MIDI controller

835
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,170
to hammer home the point further
that computer science, too,

836
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,130
has applicability far beyond engineering
and STEM and computer science itself,

837
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,890
extending even to such domains as music.

838
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:30,590
>> Colton has kindly offered-- I thought
one of them was going to fix the focus.

839
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,400
Andrew, if we could summon focus
over here for just a moment.

840
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,780
>> What Colton has done
in advance is program

841
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,345
this device, this pad of buttons
that you see pictured up here,

842
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,470
as a MIDI controller,
whereby each of those buttons

843
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:47,080
is wired to a particular musical note
or a sound, more generally a recording,

844
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,445
such that by playing patterns of these
buttons, much like patterns of bits,

845
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,620
can represent other
higher level concepts.

846
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,750
Will he be able ultimately
to take us home here today?

847
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,540
Without further ado, if
we could dim the lights,

848
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,145
and turn on the screen behind Colton.

849
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:03,865
>> AUDIENCE: Woo!

850
00:40:03,865 --> 00:40:06,090
>> DAVID J. MALAN: This is CS50.

851
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:10,518
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

852
00:40:10,518 --> 00:42:46,018

853
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:49,420
>> [APPLAUSE]

854
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,766

855
00:42:54,766 --> 00:42:56,450
>> That's it for CS50.

856
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:57,950
We will see you Friday.

857
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,890
Some cake awaits you in the Transept.

858
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,046

859
00:43:04,046 --> 00:43:08,850
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

860
00:43:08,850 --> 00:45:49,227
