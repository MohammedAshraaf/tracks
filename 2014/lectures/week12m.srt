15
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:51,200
And this is the start, and end,
of Week 12 for the very last time.

16
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,299
You'll recall from
Week 0 that we promised

17
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,340
this, that what ultimately
matters in this course

18
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,839
is not so much where you end
up relative to your classmates,

19
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:02,060
but where you, in Week 12, end up
relative to yourself in Week 0.

20
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,450
>> Well, we are here now
in Week 12, and you

21
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,420
might look back fondly, or
remarkadly, at just how far you've

22
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,180
come when this was the worst of
your problems, some weeks ago.

23
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,470
But consider how far
you've come since then.

24
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,580
Particularly, if among those with no
prior experience, just weeks later,

25
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,700
were you implementing a
fairly sophisticated data

26
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,380
structure like this hash table
here, or even this TRI here.

27
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,020
>> Just a few weeks later,
and just a week ago,

28
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,280
were you implementing this, a mash-up
of multiple APIs uisng asynchronus

29
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,700
JavaScript calls and HTTP
requests behind the scene.

30
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,510
Ultimately, creating an
entire web app from something

31
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,860
that began with just a few hash marks.

32
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,702
Now, indeed you might recall that
78% of you had no prior experience,

33
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:49,410
and we proposed that
you might be feeling

34
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,280
a little lonely at the
beginning, but realize

35
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,650
that you are now very much among
friends and supporters here.

36
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,370
>> Now, it's a tradition in CS50
to not only start the semester,

37
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,190
but also end the semester
with a bit of cake.

38
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,620
Indeed the team has been downstairs
cutting it up, and sampling the cake,

39
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,610
but that awaits in just
a little bit of time.

40
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,720
But I thought I'd pick up where we
left off and get some closure today.

41
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,149
>> You may recall this here website, I
thought the only good thing I could do

42
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,950
is write these kind folks upon having
endorsed them so in class just a couple

43
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,670
of weeks ago.

44
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,660

credit, I got back this reply

45
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,690
from ediblearrangments.com.

46
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,810
Good morning, Mr. Malan.

47
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,360
We have inquired with our IT
department regarding your concern.

48
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,620
They advise that as of next week,
there will be a website patch applied.

49
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,581
We appreciate the feedback.

50
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,080

57
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,980
>> So there you have it, CS50 here making
a difference, one website at a time.

58
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,017
So now, the final project is,
of course, all that awaits now.

59
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:05,100
And realize that there's
any number of ingredients

60
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,900
that you can weave into
this project of yours.

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,060
>> Indeed what many students do, if
tackling a web based final project,

62
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,030
will take p set 7's
distribution code, CS50 Finance,

63
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,780
and then will rip out
parts of it that are

64
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,840
of interest, or germane
to their final project,

65
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,420
like the look up function, which is
surely very specific to Yahoo Finance.

66
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,749
And they'll add in their own code,
and build atop the login mechanism

67
00:05:24,749 --> 00:05:25,790
that we provide you with.

68
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,430
And so that is absolutely a
great place to get started.

69
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,790
>> Especially if over break, and
shortly thereafter, you're

70
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,110
just not really sure where to begin to
create something that hasn't already

71
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,210
been handed to you at least in part.

72
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,600
p set 8.2, if you want to
do something with AJAX,

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,010
or you want to write a script
that imports a really big data set

74
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,230
into a database, use p
set 8 as a model in which

75
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,970
you can build your own code, ultimately.

76
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,210
But realize, too, that there's
even fancier ways to get started.

77
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,700
>> A very popular framework, that
we're fans of, is called Laravel.

78
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,960
This is a PHP framework
that essentially adds

79
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,050
to PHP a number of
features that are already

80
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,780
commonplace in the world
of Ruby and Python,

81
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,450
other programming languages
that have built into them,

82
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,880
or on top of them,
additional frameworks.

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,070
And so Laravel will take p set
7's framework, essentially,

84
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,650
and give you a whole lot
more tools for your tool kit.

85
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,630
So if curious, and if you'd like
to not only apply lessons learned,

86
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,940
but tackle some new lessons
for your final project,

87
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,610
check out this and similar
types of frameworks online.

88
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,102
>> How about hosting your website?

89
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:28,060
You can certainly put your final
project, if doing something web based,

90
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,110
on your CS50 appliance,
and most students do.

91
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,040
But if you'd like to actually take
the worldwide web out for a spin

92
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,799
and put your code out
there, realize that it's

93
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:38,840
pretty straightforward these days to
buy a domain name for a few dollars,

94
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,650
to set up your domain name's DNS
settings for the IP address stuff.

95
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,120
And then actually push your
code to some remote server

96
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,460
so that someone can visit
you at something.com,

97
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,090
or whatever domain
name you happen to buy.

98
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,240
>> Stay tuned to CS50's home
page in the days to come,

99
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,980
where we'll post some instructions
for doing exactly that.

100
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,069
If you'd like to follow
some guidance, or if you'd

101
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:58,860
like to venture out on
your own, there's so

102
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,000
many popular frameworks
and systems out there.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,850
Many of which are free, or super
cheap, or at least free for students.

104
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,090
AWS, or Amazon Web Services, is one.

105
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,410
In fact, that's where CS50 runs most of
its own servers in the so-called cloud,

106
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,770
using virtual machines, servers
that aren't really physical.

107
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,510
>> They're the illusion of physical
servers, but that we, and you,

108
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,210
could have complete control over.

109
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,880
And we just had a seminar, in
fact, a couple weeks ago on that.

110
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,530
Parse.com is a super
popular back-end tool

111
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,520
that you can use to
actually host a database.

112
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,790
If you don't want to figure out, or
stand up your own MySQL database,

113
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,962
there's this and other
related services that

114
00:07:32,962 --> 00:07:35,170
let you focus on the part
of your app that you really

115
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,150
like, the front-end
or the user interface,

116
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,730
or the features, and then outsource
to someone else, often for free.

117
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,450
Certainly for student scale
prototypes, any back-end services

118
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:47,560
like email or databases
that you might need.

119
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,210
>> Now, for authentication,
a super common FAQ in CS50

120
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,850
is, how do you authenticate users?

121
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,760
Not with their own user
names and passwords,

122
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,620
but with like Harvard IDs and PINS.

123
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,170
Well, realize CS50 has
a service called CS50

124
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,220
ID, via which you can do exactly that.

125
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,220
And then those of you tackling,
say, mobile projects, where you're

126
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,440
kind of conflicted if you want to
do an iPhone app, a Windows Phone

127
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,880
app, an Android app, or any
number of other devices out there,

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,840
realize that there are
actually tools that

129
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,830
allow you to write your app,
in typically JavaScript,

130
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,050
or some similar language.

131
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,850
And then deploy it to multiple
platforms like iOS and Android

132
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,560
and the like, phonegap
being one, Titanium another.

133
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,467
>> So if you're sort of
conflicted, and realize

134
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:29,550
that there's a bit of a
learning curve to learning

135
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,700
just one of these
languages, realize you can

136
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,080
take your own new found familiarity
with JavaScript out for a spin,

137
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,070
and apply it there.

138
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,309
And there's so much more that
you can find on your own,

139
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,460
or by consulting your TFs.

140
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,059
Now, what about life after CS50?

141
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,980
Just so that this is
said, at least once,

142
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,080
you're not going to be handed problem
set specifications and distribution

143
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,700
code in perpetuity, but realize
that you don't need the CS50

144
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,070
appliance to continue coding on Mac OS.

145
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,690
>> It's a wonderful, useful
environment in that

146
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,860
it's pre-configured to be
representative of a nice Linux system.

147
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,050
But you can certainly use any
number of freely available tools

148
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,030
these days to write code on your own Mac
without the overhead of an appliance,

149
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,770
or on your own Windows computer, or if
you're running Linux, a number of tools

150
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,714
exist there as well.

151
00:09:12,714 --> 00:09:14,630
So that's just a whirlwind
tour that you might

152
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,490
want to curl up with at some point.

153
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,060
But for now, let's take a
look ahead and what remains.

154
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,830
>> In particular among the
course's historical events

155
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,280
is the CS50 hackathon.

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,290
An epic all nighter, at which
you'll arrive around 7:00 PM,

157
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,260
set up shop with your laptop,
and project, and friends.

158
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,910
And dive into final
projects in an environment

159
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,050
that looks a little
like this upon arrival.

160
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:38,000
You'll check in here, you'll
then get down to work,

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,510
you'll help out a classmate.

162
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,680
>> You'll indulge in first dinner around
9:00 PM, second dinner around 1:00 AM.

163
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,570
And then for those still
standing at the end of the night,

164
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,004
we'll take you to IHOP.

165
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,920
But along the way there
will be a photo booth,

166
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,280
not like this, and indeed actual
CS50 shuttles on our way to IHOP.

167
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,680
>> Now, the CS50 fair, for
students in the class,

168
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,050
this is your opportunity to exhibit
proudly your final projects.

169
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,770
Not only to others, but typically 2,000
plus attendees from across campus,

170
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,380
students, faculty, folks who see
the balloons along Oxford Street

171
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,270
and come on in.

172
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,690
So realize that what awaits there are
glimpses of maybe each other's projects

173
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,320
here, where you'll bring your laptop.

174
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,100
We'll set up tall tables on which you
put your laptop, hop on the Wi-Fi,

175
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,300
and demo your projects to passers by.

176
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,090
>> Meanwhile, there will be music,
and popcorn, and candy, and more.

177
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,760
So that you'll have ample
opportunities to mingle.

178
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,600
We'll have friends of
ours from industry,

179
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
recruiters from any
number of these companies

180
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,530
here there just to chat up
students about life after college,

181
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,990
or internships during
college, and the like.

182
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,660
You'll see, too, that there's a
raffle to incentivize not only

183
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,661
you to strike up these
chats with friends,

184
00:10:40,661 --> 00:10:42,660
but also to invite your
own friends, or convince

185
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,570
your own friends to
come see your project.

186
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,060
>> You can sweeten the deal by these
little cards that will be handed out.

187
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,461
Each of them will have placeholders
for little Smiley face stickers.

188
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,960
You guys as the students will
be given Smiley face stickers.

189
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,334
And for anyone who ventures up to
you and says, hey, what did you do?

190
00:10:57,334 --> 00:11:00,000
Or asks you for a demo of your
project, you hand them a sticker.

191
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,083
They put it on their card.

192
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,910
And that qualifies them for
any number of fabulous prizes,

193
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,320
including those pictured
here, which are then

194
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,010
raffled off at the end of the event.

195
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,940

196
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,680
That's it for CS50.

197
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,200
And along the way, there will be ample
popcorn, and stress balls, and candy,

198
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,620
and even last year the
Harvard band, who was not

199
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,520
expected, but was in attendance.

200
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,590
>> There will be a photo booth there as
well, and massive numbers of balloons

201
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,480
like these ones here.

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,980
So many so, that
invariably the staff try

203
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,210
to pull this trick at the end
of the night, never quite works.

204
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,950
But for you, if you'd like to
invite your friends to this event--

205
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,360
>> SAM CLARK: Now, as we come over
to the next stop on the tour.

206
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,595
You'll notice a distinct--

207
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:43,850
>> [LAUGHTER]

208
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,730

209
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,955
>> File on in.

210
00:11:47,955 --> 00:11:53,390
You'll notice a distinct departure
from the Gothic architecture

211
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,410
that we saw on the rest of
the tour of Yale's campus.

212
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,280
Now, here we are at Sanders Theater.

213
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:04,650
Sanders Theater is really a cultural
and academic hub here at Harvard.

214
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,540
Commencement was held here until 1922.

215
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,230
It's modeled after the Sheldonian
Theater in Oxford, England,

216
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,950
as a matter of fact.

217
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,100
And it serves as a location
for many cultural events,

218
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,900
and big academic events here.

219
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,870
>> Many A cappella groups
perform in Sanders,

220
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,380
the Crocodillos perform
here frequently, they're

221
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,800
sort of like the
Wippenpoofs 2.0, almost.

222
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,020
As well as the largest class actually
at Harvard, CS50, is taught here.

223
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,460
Who on the tour is interested
in computer science?

224
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,950
Anyone interested?

225
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,660
Terrific.

226
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,590
Well, if you happen to
matriculate at Yale,

227
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,410
you'll really, really
want to be taking CS50.

228
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,829
>> [LAUGHTER]

229
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:49,721
>> [APPLAUSE]

230
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:54,451

231
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:58,420
>> You won't actually be able to take
it physically within Sanders Theater,

232
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,260
however, CS50 will be live
streamed over to you in New Haven.

233
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,520
As well as you'll have an entire
support staff, support network of staff

234
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,070
there to take CS50, to learn
all about computer science.

235
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,660
So this is Sanders Theater.

236
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,580
It's not Gothic, but it's great.

237
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,924
Does anyone have any questions
before we move on to the next stop?

238
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,359
Yeah.

239
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,820
>> AUDIENCE: Is that David Malan?

240
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,768
>> [LAUGHTER]

241
00:13:25,768 --> 00:13:27,390
>> SAM CLARK: Oh, my God it is!

242
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,270
Let's take a selfie.

243
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,770
Selfie!

244
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,530
Take a selfie!

245
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,919
Right here, right here.

246
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,960
Here, someone hold it up.

247
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,210
Someone hold it up.

248
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,615
How are you, David?

249
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,836
>> DAVID MALAN: Hello, DA

250
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:38,940
>> SAM CLARK: I'm doing well.

251
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,960
I got to flip it around.

252
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,990

253
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,070
And duck face, David.

254
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,048
>> [LAUGHTER]

255
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:50,460
>> Yeah, he likes that.

256
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,960
Terrific.

257
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,622
Terrific.

258
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,163
Well, we'll move on to the next stop.

259
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:56,480
Our next stop is the
Harvard stadium, where

260
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,374
we've had great luck
in the last 13 years.

261
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:00,342
>> [LAUGHTER]

262
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:01,794
>> [APPLAUSE]

263
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:10,520

264
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,640
>> DAVID MALAN: So the
rumors are indeed true.

265
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,460
For the first time in history,
students at Harvard and Yale

266
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,620
alike will be able to take a course
called CS50 this coming Fall in 2015.

267
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:24,380
We will put asie the rivalry
for nearly 100 years,

268
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:37,075
and ultimately, in Fall
2015, actual Yale students

269
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:39,760
will be able to take
CS50 for the first time.

270
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,650
The lectures will indeed
be streamed from here,

271
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,800
your successors in this audience,
to New Haven, where students

272
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,470
will be able to engage in
person, or as some of you

273
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,790
have so optimized, online
live, or on demand after.

274
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,110
>> But we will be standing
up a local support

275
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,860
structure, complete
with teaching fellows,

276
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,940
course assistants will be leading
sections, and office hours.

277
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,970
CS50 Puzzle Day will
be held in Cambridge,

278
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,620
and we will invite our
Yale friends to Cambridge

279
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,830
for CS50 Puzzle Day, as
well as the CS50 hackathon.

280
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,340
And then at semester's end, there will
be an epic display in both Cambridge

281
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,390
and in New Haven of CS50
students from Harvard,

282
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,200
and Yale alike on display
in those respective towns.

283
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,000
>> And indeed if you have any
friends who go to Yale,

284
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,440
we do need some TFs and CSs so
do send them to this URL here.

285
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,850
But we will in the meantime, be
sending one of CS50's own best teaching

286
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,370
fellows, Jason Hirschhorn, who's about
to graduate, having just finished

287
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,490
his thesis on the intersection of
computer science and education.

288
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,920
Jason will be working full time at
Yale, and will be on the ground there

289
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,180
helping us to stand this up and
bring these two universities together

290
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,154
via CS50.

291
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,589
>> [APPLAUSE]

292
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:52,470

293
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,850
>> Now, along with CS50's
production team, I

294
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,680
had an opportunity to hop
in the car with this guy

295
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,845
and take a look at what
awaits us in New Haven.

296
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:06,725
>> [VIDEO PLAYBACK]

297
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:11,090
>> [MUSIC - "MOVIN' RIGHT ALONG"]

298
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,000
>> -Movin' right along in search
of good times and good news

299
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,015
with good friends who can't lose.

300
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:19,900
>> -This could become a habit.

301
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,320
>> -Opportunity knocks once
let's reach out and grab it.

302
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,160
>> -Yeah!

303
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,780
>> -Together we'll nab it.

304
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,177
>> -We'll hitchhike, bus, or yellow cab it.

305
00:16:28,177 --> 00:16:29,578
>> -Cab it?

306
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:34,930
>> -Movin' right along,
footloose and fancy free.

307
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,860
>> -Getting there is half the
fun come share it with me.

308
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,330
>> -Movin' right along.

309
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,270
>> -We'll learn to share the load.

310
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,170
>> -We don't need a map to
keep this show on the road.

311
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,280
>> -Hey, Fozzy, I want you to turn left
if you come to a fork in the road.

312
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,850
>> -Yes, Sir.

313
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,380
Turn left at the fork in the road.

314
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,260
Kermit?

315
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,600
>> -I don't believe that.

316
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,500
Movin' right along, we've
found a life on the highway.

317
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,722
>> -And your way is my way.

318
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,610
>> -So trust my navigation.

319
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:11,163
>> -Movie stars with flashy cars,
and life with the top down.

320
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,261
>> -We're storming the big town.

321
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:13,760
-Yeah.

322
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,810
Storm is right.

323
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,140
Should it be snowing?

324
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,470
>> -No, I don't think so.

325
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,354
>> -Movin' right along.

326
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:22,029
>> -Footloose and fancy free.

327
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:24,118
>> -Be ready for the big time

328
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:25,917
>> -Is it ready for me?

329
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,893

330
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:33,869
>> -Movin' right along.

331
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:38,342
Movin' right along.

332
00:17:38,342 --> 00:17:42,815
Movin' right along.

333
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:44,803
Movin' right along.

334
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:47,204

335
00:17:47,204 --> 00:17:48,370
-Maybe you better pull over.

336
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,150
-Yes, Sir.

337
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,130
Oh, look at that.

>> [END PLAYBACK]

339
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,881
>> DAVID MALAN: We'll see Yale in 2015.

340
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:57,725
>> [APPLAUSE]

341
00:17:57,725 --> 00:18:00,500

342
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,960
>> So now some thank yous.

343
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,790
Suffice it to say there's an
entire family, both in front of

344
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,440
and behind the camera, in this class
that makes everything work ultimately.

345
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,020
And I'd like to acknowledge a
few, and then the entire staff

346
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,120
by way first of Colton, whose EDM
has permeated the start of lectures

347
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,627
for some number of weeks now.

348
00:18:16,627 --> 00:18:18,960
As well as the entire production
team, who's been making

349
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,830
everything look so beautiful this year.

350
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,070
Dan in Chile, and Andrew, and Cheng, and
Colton, and Ramon, and Barry in back,

351
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,740
and Kenny and everyone who's been
involved behind these cameras,

352
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,700
making everything possible.

353
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,380
To Gabriel, as well, our
head teaching fellow.

354
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,188
>> [APPLAUSE]

355
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:37,860

356
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,910
>> If you didn't already
know, Gabriel actually

357
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,890
found CS50 by way of the
production team's videos.

358
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,100
Indeed growing up in
Brazil a few years back,

359
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,720
he discovered that all of
CS50's material was online,

360
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,320
and he dropped me a
kind note asking if he

361
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,280
might be able to translate it to
Portuguese for his classmates.

362
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,060
And indeed he did, ultimately, lecturing
to some 50 students, his classmates,

363
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,760
in high school.

364
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,440
Followed by 150 students the next
year, and wonderfully his dad

365
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,480
was in fact filming the whole thing so
you can find Gabe's lectures of CS50

366
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,860
in Brazil online as well.

367
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,690
>> And now Davon here, Davon here
has been running the course,

368
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,900
and has been making
everything run so smoothly,

369
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,030
and without him we could not
manage the team that we now have.

370
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,620
And then of course, Rob Bowden.

371
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,310
>> [APPLAUSE]

372
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,810

373
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,590
>> Rob's now been with the
course some five years,

374
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,000
having approached me sophomore
year with an interest

375
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,440
in getting involved in the class.

376
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,780
And then became assistant head TF,
and then Head TF, and then Preceptor.

377
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,610
And now, believe it or not,
the very distinguished role

378
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,230
of Member of Technical Staff,
which in the computer world

379
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,010
actually carries with it some weight.

380
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,320
And so that understatement is actually
meant to be of the highest regard

381
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,520
to Rob.

382
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,310
>> Allison, of course, who's been leading
our official sections on camera once

383
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,070
a week, and making sure
there's a resource available

384
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,990
online for students who are
unable to tune-in in person.

385
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,470
And then, of course, a TF, who I think
has been at every single office hours

386
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,770
this year, including these here,
these here, those here as well.

387
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,170
And indeed [? Zamila, ?] who has walked
everyone through the course's problem

388
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,460
sets, and without whom, we could
not expect, I dare say, so much.

389
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,440
>> And then lastly, Cheng
here, who is known

390
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,640
for much more than
these elephants, which

391
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,640
have been appearing
at most every lecture.

392
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,130
Indeed Cheng recently got together
with CS50's production team

393
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,090
to put together this thank
you for the entire team,

394
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,414
by way of a little segment
we call, Cheng On The Street.

395
00:20:37,414 --> 00:20:38,382
>> [VIDEO PLAYBACK]

397
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:42,254
>> -This is Cheng with Cheng on the Street.

398
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:44,680
And today, I'm here at
CS50's Quiz One Grading

399
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,220
Party, where the staff members of
CS50 have gathered to grade quiz one.

400
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,749
I wouldn't really consider it
a party, but you get the idea.

401
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,790
I'll be asking them some questions
about their experiences this semester,

402
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:57,530
and maybe a few technical
questions, then we'll solve them.

403
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,636
>> -I don't think I'm ready for this.

404
00:20:58,636 --> 00:20:59,062
>> -It's OK.

405
00:20:59,062 --> 00:20:59,562
>> -OK.

406
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,455
-How many bits are in a byte?

407
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:02,640
>> -4, 8.

408
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,960
>> -What does PHP stand for?

409
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,430
>> -PHP?

410
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,600
Hypertext protocol.

411
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,207
>> -Is it a protocol, though?

412
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:11,790
-I don't know.

413
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,950
Is it?

414
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,870
>> -Eh, eh.

415
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,370
Buzzer.

416
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,940
>> -I know that P stands for PHP.

417
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,070
>> -So where does it stop?

418
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,070
>> -It never stops.

419
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,314
>> -It has to stop at somewhere.

420
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:20,980
-No, it doesn't.

421
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,404
-Acronyms simplify to a word.

422
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:25,074
-No, mm-mm. [? Recouragin? ?]

423
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:26,240
-This is a serious question.

424
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,052
[LAUGHTER]

425
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,050
What comes next in this
sequence of numbers?

426
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:40,192
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 955.

427
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:43,564
>> -I thought you were
going to say 64, but OK.

428
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:45,230
-What's the next number in the sequence?

429
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,286
-CS50.

430
00:21:46,286 --> 00:21:49,144
-That's not even a number.

431
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:51,010
-I have no clue.

432
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,396
-None of you are right.

433
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,890
Please, go back to grading.

434
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,582
What's 2 to the power of 64?

435
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:57,082
-Oh, jeez.

436
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,044
I should know this.

437
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:00,930

438
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,873
>> -I don't know.

439
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:02,373
-OK.

440
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:05,259

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,281
>> -How many stress balls does it
take to fill Sanders Theater?

444
00:22:11,281 --> 00:22:12,742
>> -Too many.

445
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,690
>> -You can never have
too many stress balls.

446
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,160
>> -Am I right?

447
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,294
What's the correct answer?

448
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,460
-There is no correct answer.

449
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,710
-I'm sure there is.

450
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:22,075
-It depends on the size
of the stress ball.

451
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,050
Do you know who Rob Bowden is?

452
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,490
>> -Yes.

453
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,054
He has better hair this year
than he did previous years.

454
00:22:29,054 --> 00:22:33,383
So it was a little difficult
recognizing him, but I managed it.

455
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:34,340
>> -Is he the buff guy?

456
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:34,840
>> -Yeah.

457
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,340
-OK.

458
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,100
Yeah, I like him.

459
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,780
>> -Now that you mention that,
I have a question for you.

460
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,570
>> -All right.

461
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:40,380
>> -What's Rob Bowden's bench press?

462
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,040
>> -IT max.

463
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,205
>> -What is his max bench press?

464
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:43,705
-You.

465
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:50,290

466
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,930

here in CS50.

469
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,230
We surely could not do this without
you, and we cannot wait to welcome new

470
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,105
members to the staff.

471
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:06,043
-Everyone at this
table, can we get a hug?

472
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:07,540

>> -Did I do a good job or what?

481
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:23,540
>> -You did wonderfully.

482
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,384
This was Cheng, with Cheng on the
Street, and this was CS50 2014.

483
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:29,495
>> -What did we talk about?

484
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:30,895
We just had this conversation.

485
00:23:30,895 --> 00:23:34,216

indeed now recruiting

492
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,350
for TFs, course assistants,
producers, designers,

493
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,260
and any number of other roles that
enable this to go on behind the scenes.

494
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,830
And now, for something a little special.

495
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,500
As you know, Colton has
introduced his EDM to the class,

496
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,980
but today he got the band together and
CS50, before we bring some students up

497
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,202

Colton, Gabe, and Taylor.

I can't tell where the journey will end.

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,950
But I know where to start.

00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,448
>> Try to tell me I'm too
young to understand.

505
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:44,356
Say I'm caught up in a dream.

00:24:44,356 --> 00:24:47,230

507
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,470
Life will pass me by if
I don't open up my eyes.

508
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,516
That's fine by me.

509
00:24:53,516 --> 00:24:58,020
>> So wake me up when it's all over.

510
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:02,030
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

511
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:09,230
All this time I was finding myself
and I didn't know I was lost.

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:12,724
So wake me up when it's all over.

513
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:16,845
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

514
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:23,905
All this time I was finding myself
and I didn't know I was lost.

515
00:25:23,905 --> 00:26:07,465

516
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,510
>> I tried carrying the
weight of the world.

517
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,545
But I only got two hands.

518
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:18,260
Hope I get the chance
to travel the world.

519
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,140
I don't have any plans.

520
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,020
Wish that I could stay
forever this young.

521
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,280
Not afraid to close my eyes.

522
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,686
Life's a game made for
everyone and love is a prize.

523
00:26:35,686 --> 00:26:39,590
>> So wake me up when it's all over.

524
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,006
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

525
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:50,314
All this time I was finding myself
and I didn't know I was lost.

526
00:26:50,314 --> 00:26:50,814
Everybody!

527
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:54,315
So wake me up when it's all over.

528
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:58,307
When I'm wiser and I'm older.

529
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:06,790
All this time I was finding myself
and I didn't know I was lost.

530
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,283
Didn't know I was lost.

531
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:12,279
Didn't know I was lost.

532
00:27:12,279 --> 00:28:06,171

533
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:08,167
>> [APPLAUSE]

534
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:14,780

535
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,140
>> DAVID MALAN: Coming this year to
the CS50 Fair, live music as well.

536
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,900
So now, our last opportunity for
a bit of audience participation.

537
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,760
For this we need six
students and three staff.

538
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,120
Let's see here, OK, you're
practically jumping out of your chair.

539
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,990
Come on up.

540
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:31,490
>> OK.

541
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,100
How about you two together
over here, come on up.

542
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,170
And how about you two
and you one, come on up.

543
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:43,485
Let's grow the teams a bit.

544
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:43,984
OK.

545
00:28:43,984 --> 00:28:44,483
Right there.

546
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:45,060
Come on.

547
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,850
Yeah.

548
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,710
You, come on down.

549
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,890
That's going to be hard.

550
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,890
>> OK.

551
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,390
OK.

552
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,770
Fine, come on down.

553
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,200
See you in a few minutes.

554
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,730
All right, so come on over here.

555
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,020
We're going to get two more
chairs and let's do Nick,

556
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:05,160
and Alison, and this Yale student
over here, and Rob Bowden, come on up.

557
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,900
Meanwhile, if Cheng
could join me on stage.

558
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,120

559
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,610
>> If you guys would like to form two
student teams, and one staff team.

560
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,480
And Cheng, if you could distribute these
chairs here, I'll get the board ready.

561
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,710
This is incredibly awkward.

562
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,210
OK.

563
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,360
Make your way to a chair there.

564
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,105
>> Come on over.

565
00:29:27,105 --> 00:29:32,130

566
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:32,860
Come on down.

567
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:36,990

568
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,700
And I think the Yale student will
be playing for the staff team.

569
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,804
Excellent.

570
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,470
We should have enough chairs, hopefully.

571
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,577
If not, we'll grab another.

572
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,410
Where do we need it?

573
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,790
Over here, come on over.

574
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,402
All right.

575
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:53,170
>> CHENG GONG: Do we need more staff?

576
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,003
>> DAVID MALAN: No, no.

577
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:58,600
It's going to be two student teams
and one Harvard/Yale staff team.

578
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,290
All right, so we do have this
tradition of playing Jeopardy,

579
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,970
or really, our own version of Jeopardy
where we just ask questions and expect

580
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,790
answers.

581
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,470
But the questions we're going
to ask were not written by us,

582
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,585
they were written by you.

583
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:14,860
You may recall a rather
long form for Problem Set A.

584
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,820
>> [LAUGHTER]

585
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,290

586
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,960
>> I have to admit, most of them
didn't make it into quiz one.

587
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,170
We got maybe 500 questions
asking, what is HTML?

588
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,530
What is HTTP?

589
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,000
What is CSS?

590
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,960
So they weren't exactly the
most challenging of questions,

591
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,630
but we went through hundreds
and hundreds of questions

592
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,100
to sample the following.

593
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,710
>> So Cheng here has kindly
offered to run the board.

594
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,270
We'll go ahead here and call this
Team One, Team Two, and Team Three.

595
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,930
And let's say that Team
Three has won the toss,

596
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,590
so you guys are going to glance to
your left or above you, pick a week,

597
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,990
and pick a dollar amount.

598
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,240
>> We will then ask the
question, and Cheng will

599
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,107
award you, or deduct from
you the requisite points.

600
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:58,440
Team Three, what would you like?

601
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,240

602
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,260
I'm hearing a lot of Week 0 here.

603
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,476
>> [LAUGHTER]

604
00:31:07,476 --> 00:31:08,600
STUDENT 1: Can we pick any?

605
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,845
DAVID MALAN: Any category, any amount.

606
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:13,210
STUDENT 2: Week 0, 500.

607
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,001
DAVID MALAN: You're putting more
thought into choosing the question

608
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:19,840
than I wrote into selecting them
All right, so what did you say?

609
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,100
OK.

610
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,190
And then the first
hand that goes up will

611
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,230
be considered the one who has buzzed in.

612
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,950
What is the difference between
global and local variables?

613
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,770
I saw Team Two.

614
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,275

615
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:34,650
STUDENT 3: Global-- do we just
speak into the microphone?

616
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,660

617
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,870
Global is for the entire
scope of the program,

618
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,869
whereas local is just defined
within an isolated part.

619
00:31:42,869 --> 00:31:44,160
DAVID MALAN: Let's take a look.

620
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,826
We're going to hold you to the
answer that your classmates gave.

621
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:49,840
If you click on the
text, SCOPE in all caps.

622
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,670

623
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,144

624
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,810
DAVID MALAN: I think we're going
to have to take this literally.

625
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,660
So we're not going to give those points.

626
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,070
We're going to expect exactly
what your classmates gave.

627
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:09,720
So unfortunately, we're at minus
500, but you're still in control.

628
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,700
But you're still in control--
now you're in control-- well, no.

629
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,710
You're still in control.

630
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,293
>> STUDENT 2: OK.

631
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:17,280
DAVID MALAN: You're still in control.

632
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,080
Yeah, let's go for 500 again.

633
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,380
OK.

634
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,430
Week 1, 500, Cheng.

635
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,810
What are the data types and their sizes?

636
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,722

a hand over here first.

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,489
Rob Bowden.

640
00:32:33,489 --> 00:32:38,620

641

is two bytes, an int is 4 bytes,

8 bytes, a char star is 4 bytes,

644
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:55,640
DAVID MALAN: Cheng, what
is the correct answer?

645
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,241

646
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,616
ROB BOWDEN: Oh, float and double.

647
00:32:59,616 --> 00:33:04,564

648
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:06,980
DAVID MALAN: You left out the
part of the reference sheet,

649
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,477
but I think we should
give it to him for 500.

650
00:33:09,477 --> 00:33:10,185
ROB BOWDEN: Yeah.

651
00:33:10,185 --> 00:33:12,932

653
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:15,557
ROB BOWDEN: What are you talking about?

654
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:19,390

655
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,120
>> DAVID MALAN: It's OK the points
went-- that's right, Team One.

656
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,840
I am not a good judge, apparently.

657
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,256
All right, we're going to move on.

658
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:28,210

694
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:43,753
OK.

695
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:46,699

696
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:49,790

697
00:34:49,790 --> 00:35:00,540
Week 0, for 100.

698
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,769

699
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:02,560

700
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,226

701
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,878

>> DAVID MALAN: Minus 100.

706
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,736
All right, one more
question in Single Jeopardy.

707
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:23,985
You guys are still in control.

708

711
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,082

712
00:35:34,082 --> 00:35:35,040
ROB BOWDEN: Team Three.

713
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,465
DAVID MALAN: Team Three?

714
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:35,965
OK.

715
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:37,822
We're going with Team Three.

716
00:35:37,822 --> 00:35:39,780
STUDENT 3: The best case
scenario, or run time?

717
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,780
Because the best case
scenario is it's in order.

718
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:47,571

>> DAVID MALAN: All right.

723
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,960
Let's move on to Double Jeopardy.

724
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,880
>> ALEX TREBEK (RECORDING):
This is Jeopardy.

725
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,490
>> DAVID MALAN: Double Jeopardy,
in this Double Jeopardy

726
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,205
we have the categories of
Week 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

727
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,145
>> STUDENT 3: Where did our points go?

728
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:16,480
Where did our points go?

729
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,120

730
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,730
>> DAVID MALAN: We are
going to manually adjust.

731
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,710
There we go.

732
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,540
Team Two had 2,000?

733
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,040
OK.

734
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,279
All right, so now we
tossed the coin again

735
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:29,820
and we're giving control to Team Two.

736
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,694
Go ahead and choose your
category and amount.

737
00:36:31,694 --> 00:36:34,110

738
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,590
>> STUDENT 2: We'll go Week 6, 1,000.

739
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,800
>> DAVID MALAN: Week 6, 1,000.

740
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,290
How does the stack grow?

741
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,620
Team Two.

742
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,890
>> STUDENT 5: You add a
new function into Scope.

743
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,964
>> DAVID MALAN: Add a
new function to Scope.

744
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:48,932
It grows up.

745
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:50,868
>> [LAUGHTER]

746
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:53,288

747
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:57,615
>> DAVID MALAN: All right, but
you're still in control.

748
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,494
>> STUDENT 5: All right, someone else pick.

749
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:01,369
>> STUDENT 6: I'll pick.

750
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:02,702
DAVID MALAN: It is all relative.

751
00:37:02,702 --> 00:37:04,880
Even though we tend to draw
the stack as growing up,

752
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,370
you'll recall that the addresses
actually grow in a different direction.

753
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,614
But just needed to make Rob happy there.

754
00:37:11,614 --> 00:37:13,050
All right, Team Two.

755
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,510
>> STUDENT 4: Week 8, 1,000.

756
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,640
>> DAVID MALAN: Week 8 for 1,000.

757
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,395
True or false, is HTML
a programming language?

758
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:22,137

759
00:37:22,137 --> 00:37:23,720
Is there another judge who can decide?

760
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,880
>> ROB BOWDEN: It was all me.

761
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,650
>> DAVID MALAN: All right, Rob has called.

762
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,817
>> ROB BOWDEN: It is not, so false.

763
00:37:29,817 --> 00:37:31,900
DAVID MALAN: Rob says
false, and the answer is no.

>> DAVID MALAN: All right, Yale student?

769
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,880
STUDENT 2: It was a poorly written
question, it said true or false,

770
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,004
and then it was a question.

771
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:53,162

772
00:37:53,162 --> 00:37:54,799

Double Jeopardy question.

>> DAVID MALAN: Week 9 for 1,000.

779
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:08,410
What's the difference
between ID and class?

780
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:10,010
Team Three?

781
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,080
Team Three.

782
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,800
>> STUDENT 3: You can apply ID to
only one type of thing in HTML,

783
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,570
but you can apply class
too many different things.

788
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:31,885
So if we proceed to Final Jeopardy,
I think, Team Three just wins, right?

789
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:35,390
So let's do one more question.

790
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,280
One more question, Double Jeopardy.

791
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,660
>> So at least we can pull--
that's not going to help.

792
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,930
It might help Team One.

793
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,305
All right, who's in control?

794
00:38:45,305 --> 00:38:47,570
Not me, apparently.

795
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,070

Let's proceed to Final Jeopardy.

809
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,590
Let's have everyone
come up with an answer,

810
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:24,000
and we'll have you write it on this
slip of paper as we play some music.

811
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,530
And then we'll pretend like this
was going according to plan.

812
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,760
>> All right, so Final Jeopardy
category is Week 12.

813
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,490
You all have to decide--
I didn't bring pens, no.

814
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,340

815
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,910
Pens, please.

816
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,750
Thank you.

817
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,320
All right, OK.

818
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,400
No more pens, please.
