00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,290

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:11,790
ANSEL: Hi.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,040
My name's Ansel for CS50
[? R and D. ?] Today,

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,350
we're going to walk through some of the
basics of mechanical part manufacture.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,050
So let's jump right into
it at kind of a high level,

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,500
I'll just over the basics
of what we're doing.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,410
I'm going to CAT up which stands
for-- it's just like Computer Aided

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,700
Drafting, which is just a medium
of designing a part in a computer

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,810
program called SolidWorks.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,110
>> And then from there,
we'll be able to 3D print

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,940
our part, which is a different
medium for manufacture.

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,570
If we wanted to make it
out of maybe metal perhaps,

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,260
we could machine it out of
maybe aluminum or steel.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,640
But 3D printing is kind of a nicer
way to do that for simple parts

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,710
that are not subjected to really
precise or intense stresses and strains,

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,721
just because it's a really quick
medium by which we can prototype.

17
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,970
Like I said, we're going to
be using SolidWorks today.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,844
So let's go into SolidWorks, and
I'll kind of walk through the basics

19
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:04,760
to make a new part and walk
through some of the subtleties that

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,170
are easy to gloss over.

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,410
If we go into SolidWorks here, and we
go to our file, let's open up a New.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,980
And we'll just click Part and select OK.

23
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,720
>> We have this blank canvas by
which we're able to draw our part.

24
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,620
And first, we're going to
kind of create the skeleton,

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:24,630
and then build it up, and then add in
some of the more intricate features.

26
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,590
At first, let's just
go to Sketch, which is

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,260
a kind of in the upper
left-hand column over here.

28
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,380
And we click Sketch, Sketch.

29
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,000
And then, it will give us a
choice of different planes

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,340
that we can sketch it on.

31
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,980
>> I'm going to build this part,
which is this little iPhone dock,

32
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,339
from the ground up.

33
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:43,130
It's almost as if we're
looking down on it.

34
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,580
And then, we'll build it up.

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,065
Naturally, we'll select
the top plane over here.

36
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,240
And it will highlight itself in orange.

37
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,000
And then, SolidWorks kind
of does the rest for us.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,610
>> SolidWorks is nice in that it
does a lot of the heavy lifting.

39
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,040
If you give it a geometry,
it'll just figure it out.

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,000
That'll become more apparent
as we walk through the design.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,440
>> At a high level, the dock
is just a rectangular base.

42
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,530
And then it has kind
of this lofted feature

43
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,139
here, that's just an extruded
base which holds the phone.

44
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,015
And then, it's tilted at an angle.

45
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,890
Some of the dimensions
are kind of arbitrary.

46
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,330
I think I chose in this
specific model to make the tilt

47
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,450
something like 15 degrees.

48
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,772
But that's all up to you.

49
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,480
One thing we do need
to take into account

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,700
is that when the phone is sitting in
the stand, it has some center of gravity

51
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,170
or some center of mass that
needs to hang over the stand.

52
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,415
For example, if we did not include
this part right here, then when

53
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:33,730
we put the phone in it, the center
of mass would extend beyond the base.

54
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,400
And it would just fall over.

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,810
>> What we can do is make this base
a bit wider in the back such

56
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,450
that the center of mass of
the phone is over the base,

57
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,840
with some extra kind of comfort
that's built in there such

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,170
that when you put your phone
in it, it won't fall over.

59
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,503
That's just something that
we need to take into account.

60
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,820
That's pretty simple physics.

61
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,069
>> Let's start out with the base.

62
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,870

63
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,990
And so we're already
in our sketch plane.

64
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:02,050
If we go over here and we select the
rectangle-- it's a little bit small,

65
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,520
so I'll just point to it--
select the rectangle here.

66
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,647

67
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,480
And I'm going to start it at the
origin, which is kind of arbitrary.

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,105
But that's just how I'm going to do it.

69
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:12,586
And we draw a rectangle.

70
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:13,710
Now we have this rectangle.

71
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,543
And SolidWorks knows that for
instance, the bottom and the top lines

72
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:17,280
are parallel.

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,790
And the side lines are parallel.

74
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,669
And they're all horizontal and vertical,
as denoted by these green boxes.

75
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:25,210
These green boxes a really important.

76
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,110
And I we'll kind of
talk through them a lot

77
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,260
as we continue through
the design process.

78
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,502
But essentially, they're just
saying that there is some relation.

79
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:34,335
For example on this
line right here, there's

80
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:36,370
a green box with a
vertical line next to it.

81
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,610
That's saying that
this line is vertical.

82
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,914
It's constrained to being vertical.

83
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:43,080
We can move it around and
drag it, but it will never

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
be at an angle that's not vertical.

85
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,600
>> Those green lines will
make your life a lot easier

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,760
because it will allow you
to make relations and not

87
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,030
have to do is much work.

88
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,175
SolidWorks will figure it out for you.

89
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,300
And I'll kind of talk
through that as we get to it.

90
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,890
>> What I just did to kind
of enlarge that sketch is

91
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,850
I just hit F on my keyboard, which fits
your current sketch to your screen.

92
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,970
For example, if you're
maybe really far away

93
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,800
and you just want to make it fit
nicely, just hit F on your keyboard.

94
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,550
>> Now that we're here, we can
start to add dimensions.

95
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,410
One of the most important
themes in designing a part

96
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,540
is that you can do all this CADing
and make a really pretty looking part,

97
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,440
but it needs to be physically
applicable to something.

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,070
That something in this case is a phone.

99
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,750
Our dock needs to physically
adapt to the phone.

100
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,770
>> The way that we do that
is we measure the phone.

101
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,860
And then, we had a
little bit of a boundary

102
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,630
in And there will be some
tolerance to its manufacture.

103
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,315
The tolerance concept is just
saying that when we manufacture it

104
00:04:40,315 --> 00:04:43,210
or when we print it, the
printing head is not exactly

105
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,240
at the location that we want.

106
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,450
>> It's going to be off by some
very, very small amount.

107
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,074
And that small amount is the tolerance.

108
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:52,320
And we design in that tolerance if we're
making a really sophisticated part.

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,290
But in our case, it
doesn't really matter.

110
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,940
And I'll get to that a little bit later.

111
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,670
>> Let's add some dimensions.

112
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,910
And you can do that by
clicking this button, which

113
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,725
just says Smart Dimension.

114
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:09,410
To Smart Dimension a line, we just
click on it and up pops this dimension.

115
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,010
You can move it around,
place where you want.

116
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,350
We'll place it up here for now.

117
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,320
>> And then when we click, this box pops
up and allows us to enter a number.

118
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,420
Just as kind of a
higher-level theme, it's

119
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,450
important when you're
dimensioning a line

120
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,780
to not have your dimension for this
line cross over other dimensions,

121
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,099
as it makes your drawing
or sketch pretty cloudy.

122
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,890
So we want to make it
as clear as possible.

123
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,682
>> Luckily, this dock is
a really simple part.

124
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:35,431
And we can design it pretty readily
with not that many dimensions.

125
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:38,470
But just kind of at higher level
when we're adding in more dimensions,

126
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,900
we don't want to cloud up the sketch.

127
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,815
We add this in here.

128
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:44,570

129
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,162
>> We have no idea how wide to make it.

130
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,870
So the first step is
where I'm just going

131
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,620
to grab my phone, which
is a pretty simple kind

132
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,270
of rectangular prismatic shape
with the corners rounded off.

133
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,950
And let's measure it.

134
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,780
>> This tool is called a pair of calipers.

135
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,470
This is a digital pair of calipers.

136
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,450
And I'm just going to turn
it on with the on/off button.

137
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,791
I'm just going to clean the inside
faces of any dirt or grease,

138
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:10,540
and then, zero it.

139
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,810
It's already zeroed.

140
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,966
>> It's in millimeters,
which we don't want.

141
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,090
We want it to be in inches.

142
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,140
Our whole part is being
designed in inches.

143
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,175
And if you don't know what your
current units are, in the dimension box

144
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:24,340
it says 4.4329 whatever inches.

145
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,490
>> You could design in any units and
still have a beautiful part at the end.

146
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,050
But I'm just choosing to
design this in inches.

147
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,230
That's the standard in America.

148
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm just going to change
the units up here to inches.

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,930
And wha-la.

150
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,130
>> Let's measure the width of our phone.

151
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,430
And that'll give us an idea
of how wide to make the base.

152
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,639
I'm just opening up the calipers here.

153
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,680
And I'm just going to
close it down on the phone.

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,627
And we see that it is 2.30.

155
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:55,460
Kind of wiggle it around
a little bit to get

156
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,932
the smallest dimension--
2.305 inches wide.

157
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:02,890
We want to make the base
a bit wider than that.

158
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,890
So let's say we make it, I don't
know, maybe 2 and 3/4 inches

159
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,170
wide-- so 2.75 inches wide.

160
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,790
That seems about reasonable.

161
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:19,500
Just as kind of maybe a sanity check,
we can open up the calipers to 2.75

162
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,550
or pretty close to it,
and see that there's

163
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,120
kind of enough wiggle room outside
of between the phone and the calipers

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,330
to add material to support the phone.

165
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,620
So 2.75 inches sounds reasonable.

166
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,760
>> Hit Enter.

167
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,440
And our dimension is constrained there.

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,350
Now we need to do the same
thing on the vertical line here.

169
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,640
This is kind of the tricky part that
requires-- I guess it's not tricky,

170
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,240
but it's a little bit more sophisticated
than just guessing a number.

171
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,959
This dimension that we're
adding is this distance.

172
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,250
Like I was saying before, we
can't make this too short.

173
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,070
We need to make it long enough such
that the middle of the phone, the center

174
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,850
of gravity of the
phone, is over the base.

175
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,790
You could do this by drawing
out like a free-body diagram,

176
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,210
finding the center of mass, and
then just kind of drawing this out

177
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,100
and using geometry to find it.

178
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,750
That will certainly work.

179
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,040
>> I'm just going to
ballpark it and say we can

180
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,630
make it two inches, as that seems
to be just by eyeing it, plenty.

181
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,060
You're welcome to draw it out
and figure out the geometry.

182
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,890
It's pretty simple.

183
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,190
And it won't take you too long.

184
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,440
Two inches sounds like
there'll be plenty there.

185
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,590
>> I guess as a sanity check, this is
a dock that I had made a while ago.

186
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,490
And if we place our phone in there,
we see that it doesn't tip over.

187
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,000
And this width is 1.8 inches.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,200
So two inches will be plenty.

189
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,250
Cool.

190
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,370
>> Again, we hit Enter.

191
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,840
And now, here's something
that is really important.

192
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,740
We see that all of our lines are
black and all of the points are black.

193
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,720
The line and then the points or
the nodes where they intersect,

194
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,640
are all black.

195
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,540
>> When everything in the sketch is black,
that means it's completely constrained.

196
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,240
By that, I mean that you
can't drag anything around.

197
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,310
Every point in this
sketch has been defined.

198
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,480
We can't change its location because
there are no degrees of freedom.

199
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,550
If I click on this dot here, this
intersection of these two lines,

200
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,480
and try to drag it and move
it around, it doesn't move.

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,050
>> Whereas if I kind of delete
one of these dimensions,

202
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,210
I'll just do this for the
purpose of this example.

203
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,370
If I delete this top dimension,
notice that this line is now blue.

204
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,410
So I can move it if I just
maybe click on this point.

205
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,290
It's no longer completely defined.

206
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,800
I'm just going to undo that.

207
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,540
And our sketch returns to black.

208
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,160
Great.

209
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,090
>> I'm now going to exit the sketch.

210
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,910
And we will create an extrusion from it.

211
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,830
There's this theme in
SolidWorks of creating

212
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,220
sketch is to design at a high level what
you want to do, and then extrude it,

213
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,430
which means to kind of create
material out of your sketch.

214
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,440
In this case, we've
sketched a rectangle.

215
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,230
Now we're going to extrude it,
which means create a prism out

216
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,780
of the base of that rectangle.

217
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,040
>> You can do more sophisticated things,
but we'll get to those a little bit

218
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,800
later.

219
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,000
There's no need to do
anything tricky right now.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,750
It's pretty straightforward.

221
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,280
>> The next parts of these
designs will incorporate

222
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,690
a lot of relational geometry
and relational symmetry.

223
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,940
And what that means is when you create
a feature of your part or really

224
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,020
anything, you want to relate
everything in your sketch

225
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,890
to something else--
something that's defined.

226
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,310
In this specific case, we have the
origin, which is where I started.

227
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,420
There are these two
small red vectors here.

228
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,060
>> Everything is defined in
relation to our origin.

229
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,740
So we don't have to worry about it.

230
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,824
But if we wanted to define a
feature that was symmetric,

231
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:33,240
we wouldn't have to draw it twice.

232
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,460
We could draw it once, and then
define the mirror image of it

233
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,234
to just be based off of the
symmetry from the first part.

234
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,900
That might sound a little bit confusing.

235
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,420
It'll become clearer as we
walk through the design.

236
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:50,880
>> I'm hitting Exit Sketch in the upper
left-hand part of the screen here.

237
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,450
Now we have some sketch,
which is this kind of gray.

238
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,202
We'll go to Features.

239
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:56,660
We're going to click on the sketch.

240
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,340
And it's highlighted in blue.

241
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,524
The dimensions pop up.

242
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,940
And now, I'm in this Features
tab up here in the top left.

243
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,390
You'll see that there are
a lot of them on my screen.

244
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,540
We go to Extrude Boss/Base.

245
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,880
And now our sketch has become a prism.

246
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,140
I'm going to make this-- and you
can kind of choose a side somewhat

247
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,470
arbitrarily-- let's say we're going
to make this 0.15 inches thick.

248
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,510
I'll say 0.150 inches thick.

249
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,840
>> And I'm entering that into
this box here that says D1,

250
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,660
or that's just the thickness.

251
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,250
That's the box that
SolidWorks defaults to.

252
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,520
I'm just going to turn
my sound off there.

253
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,090
And we hit the check mark.

254
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:34,780
And great.

255
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,860
Now we have the base
of our sketch defined.

256
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,490
Cool.

257
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,729
We hit that green
arrow and it goes away.

258
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,270
I said that you can choose the
thickness somewhat arbitrarily

259
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,990
because the stresses and strains that
the phone is imparting on this part

260
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,590
are minimal.

261
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,730
The phone is really light and there
is plenty of support at the base.

262
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:57,750
If we were defining this for a phone
that was maybe were incredibly heavy,

263
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,890
we would have to run some more
sophisticated analysis on this

264
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:05,069
to ensure that the base wouldn't like
buckle, or crack, or deform, or deflect

265
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:06,360
under the stresses and strains.

266
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,750
>> But I think for the context
of what we are doing here

267
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,740
and kind of anything that's
associated with 3D printing,

268
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,720
that analysis isn't really required.

269
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,230
You just can kind of assume that
it'll be strong enough, because we're

270
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,000
really not putting much force on it.

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,150
That's just kind of side note.

272
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,930
>> We have our base here.

273
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,549
You can notice that I may be
panning around a little bit.

274
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:31,090
The way that I'm doing that is
I'm holding down the jog wheel

275
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,510
on my mouse so it can jog
but you can also push down it

276
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,110
and physically hear it click.

277
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,240
I'm pushing down on that.

278
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,350
And then, I'm just
moving the mouse around.

279
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,750
Push down the middle of the
jog wheel, and we see it

280
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,400
we can manipulate our
part in three dimensions.

281
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,100
>> Now we want to sketch
this side feature here,

282
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,460
which is actually going to
end up holding the phone.

283
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,170
And I said that that'll
be at a 15 degree angle.

284
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,910
The way we do that is we can
define a sketch on the side

285
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,510
here and then extrude it down.

286
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,200
We want to kind of look
at this face of the base,

287
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,180
sketch this, all of these curves and
everything, and then extrude that up.

288
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,730
Let's do that.

289
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,540
>> We want to look at just this side.

290
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,880
Well, we can tell SolidWorks
that we want our view

291
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,837
to be kind of normal to this plane.

292
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,670
If I click on this plane, you'll
notice that this little box pops up

293
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,840
with all these options.

294
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,010
And of these options, there's
a little blue rectangle

295
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,900
with a normal vector popping out of it.

296
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,190
If we just hit that, now are
looking at the normal to this plane.

297
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,540
We're looking down on this side
plane, which is what we want to do.

298
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,840
>> As this is still
selected, we go back over

299
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,720
here to Sketch which is in
this View tab over here.

300
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,127
And we'll hit Sketch.

301
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:43,710
And now we're sketching on this plane.

302
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,470

303
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,130
Great.

304
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,546
Now we're sketching on this plane.

305
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:51,580

306
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,990
>> We will add-- this is not going
to be kind of a standard rectangle

307
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,010
because the top line and the
bottom line are no longer parallel,

308
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,120
because we decided to put
the phone at an angle.

309
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,369
You don't need to put
your phone at an angle.

310
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:06,160
If it were vertical,
that would still work,

311
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,380
though it might not hurt
have kind of tab in front.

312
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,280
>> That would look kind of silly.

313
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,470
Having it pointed at an
angle is just a nicer design.

314
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,129
Also, if somebody's walking
up to your table or your booth

315
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:20,420
and your phone is on display displaying
an app, it's just kind of visually more

316
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,990
pleasing to have your phone
tilted back a little bit, kind

317
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,790
of in the way that your computer
screen is tilted back a little bit.

318
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,760
>> Let's see.

319
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,040
How did I design is the first time?

320
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,120
Let's go like this.

321
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,990
We're going to go to
this bottom corner here.

322
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,930
And I'm just going to
draw a line up here.

323
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,387
And I'm just kind of
roughing out the shape here.

324
00:14:45,387 --> 00:14:46,720
Don't worry about the relations.

325
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,344
We'll take care of those in the second.

326
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:51,590

327
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,680
>> To exit the line drawing, I just double
click and that gets you out of there.

328
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,970
If you hit this green arrow
in the left pane over here,

329
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,064
that means that we can
exit drawing a line.

330
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,480
Now we have something that
kind of resembles what we need.

331
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,330
>> But here is an important part, and
this is what I was saying before.

332
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,255
We need to add a
relations to everything.

333
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:11,270
The analogy could be drawn to
when you're writing a script

334
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,230
and you're using a
constant pretty frequently,

335
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,930
you might define the constant
at the beginning of your file,

336
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,944
and then use it kind of
throughout your code, such

337
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:22,110
that if you need to change this number,
you only need to change it one time.

338
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,430
And then, it will kind of
propagate through your code.

339
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,257
>> It's a very similar case here.

340
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:28,090
If we define all of
these relations, we only

341
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:31,240
need to add the dimension one
time because everything else is

342
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,300
going to be redundant.

343
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,910
So that later on if we want to go
back and tweak the design maybe,

344
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,180
you only need to change one dimension.

345
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,900
For example, this line and
this line need be parallel.

346
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,040
But they're not right now.

347
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,560
So let's make them parallel.

348
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,680
>> We click on one.

349
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,429
Now I'm holding Control on my keyboard
and I'm clicking on the other one.

350
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:50,720
And now, they're both selected.

351
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
And this little box pops up.

352
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,042
And there, one of these
options is Make Parallel.

353
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:57,250
We select that, and now
these two lines are parallel.

354
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,940
Cool.

355
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,180
>> We want this line, and
again holding down Control

356
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,960
to select both at the same time,
this line to be perpendicular.

357
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,420
One of these options
is Make Perpendicular.

358
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,730
If you select these two lines and
maybe you're not seeing this box,

359
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,200
you can hover over to
this left panel over here

360
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,910
and it has all of the same options--
perpendicular, parallel, equal.

361
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,180
Equal means equal in length.

362
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,990

363
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,770
>> We're going to again do this.

364
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,920
Just by induction because I made these
two perpendicular and just by geometry,

365
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,420
these two have to be perpendicular.

366
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,080
But it can't hurt to add
in that second relation.

367
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,140
>> Now let's make this point
and this line coincident.

368
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,070
Again, I'm just hitting
this option Make Coincident.

369
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,370
Now we have the general
shape of the structure

370
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,790
that's actually going
to hold the phone up.

371
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,400
I'm going to just hit F there
to kind of center this out.

372
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,650

373
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,690
Looks pretty good.

374
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,530
>> I'm just going to go back here to
viewing this plane at a Normal .

375
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:06,160
If that box is not popping
up for you, there is a panel

376
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,950
up again here at the top
of your sketching field

377
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,260
where there's kind of
this like box outline.

378
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,490
You can hit that, and
this little menu pops up.

379
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,770
And again, you have the Normal
to operation available to you.

380
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,329
>> Now let's define that 15 degree
tilt that I was saying before.

381
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,880
We're going to go to Smart Dimension.

382
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,480
Smart Dimension is just that smart.

383
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,180
It can dimension the length of lines.

384
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,970
It can dimension angles
between two lines.

385
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,650
It just figures it out.

386
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,830
>> If we select this vertical line
and then select this angled line,

387
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,880
it shows us kind of
the angle between them.

388
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,602
If we click on that, this is in degrees.

389
00:17:42,602 --> 00:17:44,060
I guess you could do it in radians.

390
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,120
Degrees I think is more natural.

391
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,351
I'm just going to 15.0
degrees, hit Enter.

392
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:49,850
Cool.

393
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,580
And now, it's completely constrained.

394
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:58,420
>> We can also define the length of this
line, again using Smart Dimension.

395
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:04,690
And we can say, I'm just ball
parking this kind of by eye,

396
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:09,430
seems like maybe 5/8 of
an inch would be enough.

397
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,920
I'll just say 5 divided by 8.

398
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,939
You can do operations in
the Smart Dimension field

399
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:17,730
like addition,
multiplication, subtraction.

400
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,380

401
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,550
>> And we hit that.

402
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,550
And now, we have these dimensions.

403
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,510
You might say oh no,
two of these dimensions,

404
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,250
the angle dimension and the
length dimension, are crossing.

405
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,250
That's not too pretty, which
I would definitely agree with.

406
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,490
You can bring that in
here to eliminate that.

407
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,990
>> We'll notice though that one
of our lines are still blue.

408
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,864
We want everything in
this sketch to be black

409
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:41,550
before we do any type of extruding.

410
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,000
We need to constrain this.

411
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,220
If you look at this, it
might not be obvious to you

412
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,771
where the degree of freedom is.

413
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:51,270
If we want to figure that out,
we can exit Smart Dimension--

414
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,850
which I do by just clicking it
again to turn it off-- and then drag

415
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,430
one of these points.

416
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,660
>> We notice that this can move
along this degree of freedom,

417
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,270
which we can prevent by describing
the length of this line.

418
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,145
We'll go back to Smart Dimension.

419
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:11,530
And we're going to
dimension this line here.

420
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,450
And we'll call that the
thickness of the phone

421
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,257
plus the thickness of our material.

422
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,840
I don't know how thick that should be.

423
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,220
We can pretty simply measure it.

424
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,940
I'll just go grab our calipers here.

425
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,860
And I'm just going to
measure the thickness

426
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:32,530
of the phone It's showing
here 0.303 inches.

427
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,556
I have a screen protector on my phone.

428
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:36,930
It's probably not going to
make too much of a difference.

429
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,440
0.303 inches plus two times
the thickness of the wall-- we

430
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,050
can kind of I guess at
the thickness of the wall.

431
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,940
>> Like I said, this structure
will be plenty strong.

432
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,390
We don't really need to worry
about making the walls too thin,

433
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,780
unless your paper thin.

434
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:58,560
So let's say 0.303 inches
plus parens two times

435
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,800
the wall thickness, which I'm going
to say is-- I'm just guessing here--

436
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,440
I'll say 0.15 inches, which is the
thickness that I made the base.

437
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,420
It seemed to work.

438
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,010
Cool.

439
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,330
>> SolidWorks does all the math.

440
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,560
We can kind of drag this dimension to
make it look a little bit prettier.

441
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,400
Nice.

442
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,087
Hit our green arrow and
we are completely defined.

443
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:19,920
Everything is black.

444
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,080
This is great.

445
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,430
>> One thing, and this is
just an aesthetic point,

446
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,500
is there's this little triangle here.

447
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,990
Well we don't want that triangle to
be sticking out when we extrude it,

448
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,070
because it'll look like
a hump in the front face.

449
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,610
We want it to be smooth.

450
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,664
To eliminate that, we can do
what's called an extrusion.

451
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:38,080
There are two types of extrusions.

452
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,160
There's kind of extruding
to create material

453
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,520
and extruding to remove material.

454
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,750
We'll extrude to create material
in making this feature here

455
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,850
that will hold the phone.

456
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,440
And then, we can remove material here.

457
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,180
And I'll get to that in a second.

458
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,187
>> Let's first exit our sketch.

459
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:54,520
We have the sketch here defined.

460
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,297

461
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,005
We can go over here
and click our sketch.

462
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:02,420
One thing that I will note
is this list of things

463
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,950
on the left-hand panel is
called the Feature Tree.

464
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,050
Just like when you're maybe
creating variables in your code,

465
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,790
you want to label them in a way
that's pretty self explanatory.

466
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,890
We should label everything
in our Feature Tree

467
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,420
to also be pretty self explanatory here.

468
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,130
>> This Boss Extrude 1,
if we click on that,

469
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,000
it highlights in blue what the
feature is, which is the base.

470
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,210
But just glancing at the Feature
Tree, if I saw Boss Extrude 1,

471
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,510
that's not at all illustrative
to what it does functionally.

472
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,550
We can rename that.

473
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,410
And the way to do that is just
once it's highlighted in blue, just

474
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,610
click and hold.

475
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,300
And now, you'll see that you
have the ability to rename it.

476
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,250
Let's call that Base.

477
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,990

478
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,440
>> Now if we click on Base,
again the base will highlight.

479
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,749
And I think that's just
a lot more helpful.

480
00:21:45,749 --> 00:21:48,540
It might not really make a difference
in a simple design like this,

481
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,670
but for a really complicated part
or one that has a lot of features,

482
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,040
it will help you.

483
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,550
>> Let's now extrude this part.

484
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,180
We're going to click
on our sketch, go back

485
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:05,070
to Features in this
tab display pane here.

486
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,940
And we are going to go
Extrude Boss/Base again.

487
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,320

488
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,830
It's asking us reverse
direction to sketch.

489
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,970
Well, that might not
initially be obvious to us

490
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,070
which direction that is, so we can
hit Yes and kind of correct it later.

491
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,400
>> We're going to click
on our feature here.

492
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,780
And oh no, we see that it is
extruding in the wrong direction.

493
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,940
That's a pretty easy thing to correct.

494
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,580
We just need to tell the extrusion to
extrude it in the opposite direction.

495
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,920
>> In our left pane over here, you'll
notice that there are these two arrows.

496
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,920
And when we hover over it,
it says Reverse Direction.

497
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,830
So if we click on that, now
we notice that it is now

498
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:49,050
extruding in the correct direction.

499
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,190
>> Right next to that is
kind of a drop down.

500
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,910
And there a bunch of options in
here-- Blind, Through All, Up To Next.

501
00:22:54,910 --> 00:23:00,510
We want to, I guess we could
enter the thickness of our base

502
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,530
as the dimension for
how deep to extrude it.

503
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,790
But that's kind of
sketchy-- no pun intended.

504
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:12,880
Let's go to Up To Next.

505
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,470
Oops, sorry.

506
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:21,730
I believe it iis-- I
thought it was Up To Next.

507
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,896

508
00:23:24,896 --> 00:23:26,770
You can just click on
the surface here if you

509
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:30,000
don't know which one it
is, like I did not just.

510
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,750
SolidWorks will figure it out for you.

511
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,190
We'll hit our green arrow.

512
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,240
And now we have the feature that
will be actually holding the phone.

513
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,030
It's now starting to resemble what it
will look like in the final product.

514
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:44,530
>> You might think at this point
well, in the finished product

515
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,060
there's this kind of curve here.

516
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,230
And it's curved on the back I don't
know if you can really see that.

517
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,990
And we didn't sketch that in.

518
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,460
Those features are what
are called fillets.

519
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,470
Fillets are something that we
use in mechanical engineering

520
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,220
to eliminate stress concentrations.

521
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,390
>> You can imagine if you have a part
that has two lines coming together

522
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,520
at a really shallow angle, they'll
create kind of a really sharp point.

523
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,550
And if that part is subjected to any
stresses and strains in that plane,

524
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,900
all of those stresses will concentrate
at the vertex of that point.

525
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,000
So to eliminate that,
we add a fillet, which

526
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,220
just rounds that surface off
and smooths everything out.

527
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,020
>> If you're interested in kind of the
logic and the material science by that,

528
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,550
just Google "stress concentrations."

529
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,970
But at a high level, fillets
make it look nicer too.

530
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,100
So we'll add those in.

531
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,820
We'll do that kind of at the
end, as that's pretty quick.

532
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,990
>> You'll notice though that there's
this hump that I was talking about.

533
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,365
And it does not look good at all.

534
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,440
So let's get rid of that.

535
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,330
We're going to just
highlight this face here.

536
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,500
Oops, I did not mean to do that.

537
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,985
Highlight this face here
and go Normal to it.

538
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,760
And we're just going
to add a sketch here

539
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,050
that will get rid of
this little triangle.

540
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:57,475
>> Let's relabel this Boss Extrude 2
to be, let's just say Phone Support.

541
00:24:57,475 --> 00:25:00,280

542
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,470
And if we hit the little
Plus button right here,

543
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,840
you'll see that there is a sketch here.

544
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,870
By default, SolidWorks kind of
hides the sketches away from you

545
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:12,380
once you're done with them, as it
will kind of cloud how the part looks.

546
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:15,870
But we need to reference some
of the geometry that's in it.

547
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,640
>> If we just kind of hover over
it, this little box pops up.

548
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,560
And there are these I guess
they're little glasses.

549
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,350
We can hit that button.

550
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,330
And now the sketch is visible to us.

551
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,070

552
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,680
Or at least, it should be.

553
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,080
Yeah.

554
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,466
If I just hit F here to zoom
in, you'll notice that now

555
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:38,090
that we have access to all of
these lines and their dimensions.

556
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,540
>> The cool thing about this is we can
create another sketch that actually

557
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,180
references the geometry
of a different sketch.

558
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,880
If we sketch on this plane, which
we can do by just highlighting it,

559
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,604
hitting Sketch in this upper toolbar
over here, and then Sketch again,

560
00:25:52,604 --> 00:25:54,020
now we're sketching on this plane.

561
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,603
And we're actually just going
to create a little triangle here

562
00:25:56,603 --> 00:25:59,080
that references all of these
points that we made before.

563
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,340
And then, we're just going to
extrude that away or cut it away.

564
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,010
>> Let's just go create lines
are here, zoom in a little bit

565
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,830
so this is clearer.

566
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,530
Start at the vertex down here,
you can see I'm drawing a line.

567
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,070
I'm going to bring it to this
point, bring it to this point,

568
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,502
and make it closed.

569
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:17,460
And you'll see that all
of the lines are black.

570
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,630
And we didn't even need
to add in any dimensions.

571
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,755
That's because we've already defined
those dimensions in a previous sketch.

572
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,590
And now, we're referencing
those geometries.

573
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,370
>> We hit Green Check,
Insert Line, Green Check.

574
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,810
Now that's completely defined.

575
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,130
We'll exit this sketch.

576
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,080
And we're going to cut that
little triangle that we made away,

577
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
and down the arrow or I
guess in this orientation,

578
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,400
down the direction of our support.

579
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,610
Cool.

580
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,880
>> I'm just going to go here.

581
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,042
Now, we're not going
to Extrude Boss/Base.

582
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,500
We're not going to create material.

583
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,440
We want to cut material away.

584
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,560
A few options over, there's
this option to Extrude Cut.

585
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,450
Let's hit that.

586
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,170
And you'll notice now, that SolidWorks
is going to take material away

587
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,624
from this triangle that we've defined.

588
00:26:59,624 --> 00:27:01,415
Let's go and let's just
click this surface.

589
00:27:01,415 --> 00:27:08,150

590
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,650
No.

591
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,160

592
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,550
And you can select the option
Through All in this drop down.

593
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,870
All that does is it will
extrude this forever.

594
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,300
Our part doesn't exist forever.

595
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:24,222
It only exists for a couple of inches.

596
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:25,930
It will take everything
that we need off.

597
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,120
>> That's typically a pretty
easy way to do cuts.

598
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,910
You just kind of cut all
of that material away.

599
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,940
Whereas in extrusions,
you want to define

600
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,010
how much material you want to create.

601
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,150
We'll hit our green check mark.

602
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,680
>> And all of that material goes away.

603
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,109
And now, we're left
with this smooth face.

604
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,400
We don't really need this
sketch anymore, so we go back

605
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,500
and hide it, which we can just do
again by right clicking and now hitting

606
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,680
the Hide button.

607
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,660
And it has disappeared.

608
00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:01,340
>> I guess we can label this cut by just
saying Front Face Cut, hitting Enter.

609
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,500
We'll just make it a little bit clearer.

610
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,340
Cool.

611
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,540
We're getting there.

612
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,060
We just have a couple
of things left to do.

613
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,840
>> What we're going to now do is add.

614
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,820
You'll notice that there is
a rectangular cut in here.

615
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,890
It's what the phone
actually slides into.

616
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,730
And then I just made
a little cut here so

617
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,550
that you can access the Home
button of this particular phone

618
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,460
while it's sitting in the dock.

619
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,910
Let's add those two features in.

620
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:28,549
And we'll add a couple of finishing
details and we'll be done.

621
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:31,340
This is, you might think, well,
how are we going to sketch on this?

622
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,100
We don't want to sketch on this face.

623
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,660
We can just sketch on this face.

624
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,340
We're going to hit Normal to.

625
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,920
And now we have access to
sketching on this face.

626
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,350
And we're looking down it.

627
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,350
>> It's kind of the same process here.

628
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,450
There's kind of this
rhythm where we select

629
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,180
a face that we're going to sketch on.

630
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,937
We look at it at the normal, so
that we're looking down on it.

631
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:52,270
And then, we create some sketch.

632
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,061
And then, we do something
with that sketch.

633
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:58,240
Maybe we make a cut or we create
some material with Extrude Boss/Base.

634
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,860
>> Same thing again here as we've
done the previous two iterations.

635
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,240
We're looking down on it.

636
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,329
We want to select it
as a sketch surface.

637
00:29:06,329 --> 00:29:07,370
It's highlighted in blue.

638
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,320
So again, we hit Sketch, Sketch
just as we've done before.

639
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,776
And now we've created our
sketch and we'll make that cut.

640
00:29:14,776 --> 00:29:16,650
One thing that we need
to be aware of though,

641
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,649
and this will come into
play in just little bit,

642
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:21,230
is that the corners of
our phone are rounded.

643
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,832
If we just make this kind of a prismatic
cut, the phone will still fit inside,

644
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,290
but it might kind of wiggle around.

645
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,620
It might not be as secure.

646
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,770
>> We can add little complements
in here to complement

647
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,630
the rounded corners of our phone.

648
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,800
It's kind of a small detail.

649
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,390
And it won't make too much
a difference, but it's

650
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:42,220
nice to kind of design
the part in its entirety.

651
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,260
>> Let's go here.

652
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:48,430
We're going to just draw a
rectangle on our surface here.

653
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,900
And cool.

654
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,990
Now let's define it.

655
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,180
We're going to go to
Smart Dimension here.

656
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,305
Let's define it to be the width of our
phone, which I've already forgotten.

657
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:02,670

658
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:11,010
I'm just measuring it
here-- 2.305 inches.

659
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,860
>> And we're going to kind of add
a little comfort zone to that

660
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,720
so that you can easily take the
phone in and out of the dock

661
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,330
without having to kind
of pull them apart.

662
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,270
That would be kind of what we call
that is that they're interfering.

663
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,920
And we don't want that here.

664
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,450
We want it to be easy
to take it in and out.

665
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:33,800
>> We said 2.305 inches is the width.

666
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,550
And then, we'll add kind
of a comfort spacing

667
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,770
or a buffer spacing on each side.

668
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,050
So let's say two times some thickness.

669
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,280
What is that thickness going to be?

670
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,307
We can just kind of guess
arbitrarily here at some thickness.

671
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,140
If you have calipers
with you, you can maybe

672
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:59,170
open them up to say,
I don't know, 25 thou.

673
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:07,450
25 thou is 25 thousandths of
an inch or 25 times 0.001.

674
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,550
I'm just kind of guessing here, but
I think that'll be enough spacing.

675
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:19,570
We'll do that on each side-- say
20 thou-- two times 0.020 inches.

676
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,240
>> That is now the width that needs to be.

677
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,800
And we'll define its height.

678
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,190
This will be the thickness of
our phone plus that same buffer.

679
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,960
I think it was 0.303
inches, but I'm not sure.

680
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,910

681
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,960
0.303 inch is the
thickness of the phone.

682
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,000
>> Let's say 0.303 plus two times 0.020.

683
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,626
| at 20 thousandths thick
buffer on each side.

684
00:31:49,626 --> 00:31:51,625
And I just multiplied it
by two because, there's

685
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:54,560
a buffer inside, the front and
the back and side and side.

686
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,780
Hit Enter.

687
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,600
Cool.

688
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,127
>> Now you might be
thinking, oh my gosh, why

689
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,960
is this all blue when we have just
defined the width and the height?

690
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,621
That's because we haven't
located it on this plane.

691
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:06,120
We can do this pretty easily though.

692
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,040
We don't need to add dimensions in
because we want it to be centered.

693
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,190
>> We don't need to add
dimensions in to say

694
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,319
this line should be so and so
inches away from this line.

695
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,360
We don't need to do that.

696
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,450
We can have SolidWorks
figure that out for us.

697
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,620
And one way to do that-- and this is
kind of I think one of the easier ways

698
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,500
to do it-- is to add lines and
then add relations to them.

699
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,332
And these can be called
construction geometries.

700
00:32:28,332 --> 00:32:30,290
A construction geometry
is just a line that you

701
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,916
don't plan on doing anything with
as far as extrusions are concerned.

702
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,790
You're not going to cut
with it or you're not

703
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,220
going to create material with it.

704
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,319
You're just going to
use it as a reference.

705
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,610
That might sound kind of lofty.

706
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,886
I'll nail that down here.

707
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,010
We're still in Sketch mode.

708
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,530
If we go the Line and hit
this little arrow next to it,

709
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,940
this drop down will come.

710
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,940
And we have a Normal line option,
which is what we've been using before,

711
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,240
or a Center line, which will
create a construction geometry.

712
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,180
Let's hit that.

713
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,950
And this will create a dashed line.

714
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,780
>> Let's draw a line between
this side and here like so.

715
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,290
Zoom in and you can
see that it's dashed.

716
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:12,050
And then, let's do it again over here.

717
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,610
If we make these two lines
equal, our smaller rectangle

718
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:20,030
will be centered at least horizontally
inside the bigger rectangle.

719
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,084
They don't need to
necessarily be co-linear,

720
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:24,250
meaning that they don't
need to be on the same line.

721
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:29,930
But they do necessarily need to be
perpendicular to both of these faces.

722
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,930
>> Let's hit OK and let's
start adding relations.

723
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:34,390
SolidWorks is smart enough
to know that just by the way

724
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,990
I drew it they are
both horizontal, as you

725
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,342
can see by these horizontal lines
here-- this little green box.

726
00:33:40,342 --> 00:33:42,300
So we don't even need to
do anything with that.

727
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,220
All we need to do now is equate them.

728
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,370
And SolidWorks will now center the box.

729
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:51,160
>> We highlight one, go over here
and highlight the other-- again,

730
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,305
holding down Control and clicking on it.

731
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:55,520
And say, make them equal.

732
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,890
And like that, SolidWorks
has centered the box.

733
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:03,782
Again, I'm just zooming out by
rolling on the jog wheel on the mouse.

734
00:34:03,782 --> 00:34:05,490
And we could, if we
wanted to, pan around

735
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,114
by again holding down on the jog wheel.

736
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,779
Let's do the same process
to center it vertically.

737
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:11,070
I'm just going to go down here.

738
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:18,739
I'll go a little bit faster this
time, create this vertical line,

739
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,920
create another vertical line.

740
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,709
Again, I'm double clicking
to get out of Line mode.

741
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,250
And then, we hit our green arrow now.

742
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:32,530
>> And let's equate them-- click one,
Control click, highlight the other,

743
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,690
and then Make Equal.

744
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,860
Now everything's black,
and we're going to go.

745
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,260
Exit the Sketch, kind of the same thing.

746
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,820
Now we're going to make
an extruded cut down here.

747
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,570
And it's up to us now how
thick we want to make that cut.

748
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,469
>> This doesn't so much matter.

749
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,969
It's kind of up to us.

750
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:52,600
I'll say just based
on the geometry maybe

751
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,230
it'll be double what it is right now.

752
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,400
Right now, it's at 0.15 inches thick.

753
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,880
If we make it 0.3 inches
thick, that looks pretty good.

754
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,711
We can probably go a little bit
deeper-- maybe 0.40 inches thick.

755
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:08,210
Yeah.

756
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,090
That looks good.

757
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,450
Hit the green arrow.

758
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,090
And now we have this slot
that the phone will sit in.

759
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,690
>> Now, we need to add kind of this
little cut out for the Home button.

760
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,734
I guess this is not
completely necessary if you

761
00:35:20,734 --> 00:35:22,900
don't need to use your phone
while it's in the dock.

762
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,980
But it's a nice feature to have.

763
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,210
And it takes little effort on our
end, so we may as well add it in.

764
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:29,710
Same thing.

765
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,920
Let's highlight this
face, go Normal to it.

766
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,370
And we're just going to sketch
on this face and we'll be done.

767
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,950
Again, his Sketch, Sketch.

768
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,810
Now, we're going to draw a circle.

769
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:44,380
We can just kind of go up here into
our shapes menu and click Circle.

770
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,450
And let's just draw a circle
kind of in the middle of nowhere.

771
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,990
And we'll start to add relations to it.

772
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:54,020
>> We're going to create a vertical
line that the center of the circle

773
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,470
will be coincident with.

774
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,840
And that way, our circle
is centered on the phone.

775
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,850
And when we slip the
phone into the dock,

776
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,450
the Home button will line up with
the cut out for the Home button,

777
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,410
because we know that the Home button
on our phone is in the center of it.

778
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,650
>> We're going to go here
and create a center line.

779
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,800
And I'm just going to find the
midpoint of this bottom line.

780
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,130
If I try to start a line
on this bottom line,

781
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,080
you'll notice that there
is a little yellow button.

782
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,230
And when we hover over that, this
little icon pops up next our pencil.

783
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,000
And that icon is aligned with a
green dot in the middle of it.

784
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,410
>> When you see that icon, that means that
that's the center point of that line.

785
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,040
So if we draw off of that,
we click and draw upwards,

786
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,290
we've just drawn a vertical
line from that midpoint.

787
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,840
I did that kind of quickly,
so I'll just do it again.

788
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,465
And let's say that I don't see that.

789
00:36:43,465 --> 00:36:44,590
It's not popping up for me.

790
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,460
We can do it even a simpler way.

791
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,560
>> We'll go to center line.

792
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,920
And we'll draw.

793
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,386
We have this line here.

794
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:52,760
But it's not at the center point.

795
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,590
It's not centered against here.

796
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,230
So what we can do is, we can draw a
point, which we go to our Shapes menu,

797
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,200
see a Point, find the midpoint here.

798
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,276
You see that it pops up when we get
close to it-- drop point there, here.

799
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:09,400
The one thing you may notice that's
different about all the other shapes is

800
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,149
the point thing is
still highlighted, even

801
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:13,370
after you click the green check mark.

802
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,210
Just hit it again to unhighlight it.

803
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,755
And that will make this point and
the base of our line be coincident.

804
00:37:19,755 --> 00:37:22,150
It accomplishes the same task.

805
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,940
>> Now we're going to take the
center of our Home button,

806
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,160
Control click our vertical line,
highlight the both of them,

807
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,410
and make them coincident.

808
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,019
Now our Home button is centered.

809
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:33,310
We can't move it left to right.

810
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,820
We can only move it up and down.

811
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,830
And we can change its diameter.

812
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,019
>> How big should we make it?

813
00:37:38,019 --> 00:37:38,560
I don't know.

814
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,915
Let's measure it.

815
00:37:39,915 --> 00:37:44,470
If we look on our phone
here, we take our calipers,

816
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,590
and we can measure the
diameter of the Home button.

817
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,550
And it's nice to give it kind
of a little bit of wiggle room,

818
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,060
so we'll make it a little bit
bigger than it needs to be.

819
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,390
>> That's because when your
phone is sitting in the dock,

820
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,760
if it were exactly the
size of the Home button,

821
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,565
you kind of have to stick your
finger like perpendicularly in

822
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:04,300
to be able to access the Home button.

823
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,420
Whereas, if we make it bigger,
you can kind of hit it at an angle

824
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,300
and see all the snapshots
that you have missed.

825
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,380
>> Let's go here and we'll
measure on the phone.

826
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,170
And I'm just eyeing it again here.

827
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,830

828
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:23,256
That looks to be
comfortable. it says 0.674.

829
00:38:23,256 --> 00:38:24,700
We'll make a round number.

830
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,441
Let's say 0.65.

831
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:26,940
Yeah.

832
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,850
That seems comfortable.

833
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,780
Some of this is kind of
guesswork because we're not

834
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,910
designing a really kind
of nailed-down part.

835
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,454
This part's not
accomplishing any real task.

836
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:38,620
It's just holding something.

837
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,035
So it's OK to do a
little bit of guesswork.

838
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:43,570

839
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,110
>> Let's Smart Dimension this diameter.

840
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,570
We just said it was
going to be 0.65 inches.

841
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,690
We go up in our menu up in the top left.

842
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,210
Again, hit Smart Dimension.

843
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:53,220
If you just click
anywhere on the circle,

844
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,401
it's smart enough to know that
we're talking about the diameter.

845
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,400
Whether you kind of drag
it off to the side here

846
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,680
and it gives you that little phi
symbol or you hold it directly above,

847
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,770
it's the same thing.

848
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,590
You're defining its diameter.

849
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,070
>> Let's click here and
we're going to say 0.650.

850
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:09,750
Hit Enter.

851
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,650
And now, the diameter is defined.

852
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,410
And what we need to do now is
define the height from the bottom.

853
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,909
This is probably the trickiest
part of this whole operation.

854
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:20,160

855
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,940
>> In doing so, we want
the center of our circle

856
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,500
to line up with the
center of the Home button.

857
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,400
Just by kind of eyeing it
again with a pair of calipers,

858
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,210
we can measure the distance between
the center of our Home button

859
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,160
at the bottom of the phone.

860
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,112
Ideally, we would have a really
detailed spec sheet of our phone

861
00:39:38,112 --> 00:39:40,570
and we could just look at the
spec sheet and figure out oh,

862
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,090
the center of this button
is so and so inches

863
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,180
from the bottom plane of the phone.

864
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,145
>> But we don't have access to
that, so we'll just measure it.

865
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:52,379
And it'll be pretty accurate.

866
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:54,170
I'm just kind of eyeing
it here, the center

867
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,920
of the Home button to
the bottom of the phone.

868
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:05,930
It looks to be about 0.329
inches, maybe a little bigger.

869
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:12,900

870
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:21,520
Let's call it 0.348 inches.

871
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,260
>> We now know that the
bottom plane of our phone

872
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,350
is 0.348 inches away
from the center line.

873
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:30,310
But the bottom plane of
the phone is at some angle,

874
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:32,400
so how are we going to figure this out?

875
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,510
I don't know.

876
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,020
Let's go to our Cut Extrusion
here, which I notice now

877
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,140
that I did not label,
so we can do that now.

878
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,890
We'll call this Phone Slots.

879
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:49,244

880
00:40:49,244 --> 00:40:51,660
And there are a couple different
ways that we can do this.

881
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,530
We can say, we can Smart Dimension
it in a couple of different ways.

882
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,850
By this angle-- and this gets into
of this is a little bit more tricky--

883
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:05,260
let's look at it at an angle where
we have access visually to the plane

884
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,480
where the phone is going to be
sitting on and our Home button.

885
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,130
>> We go into Smart Dimension, and I'm
going to dimension from this line

886
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:16,090
to the center of our hole
here, which gets highlighted.

887
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,500

888
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,686
And now, I don't even
remember what the number.

889
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:23,310
I'm just going to quickly remeasure it.

890
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:33,560
I think it was 0.348.

891
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,480
Yeah, 0.348 sounds good.

892
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,903
Now we'll add that 0.348 in-- 0.348.

893
00:41:39,903 --> 00:41:41,870
Hit Enter.

894
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,990
And our phone is defined.

895
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,490
Our button is defined.

896
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,450
Hit the check mark.

897
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:53,420
>> And here's kind of a subtle point
that would be kind of easy to miss.

898
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,850
You'll notice that the center of our
circle actually sits below this line.

899
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,480
That means that if we
extrude through the sides

900
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,740
where the Home button cut out is made,
we'll actually start to curve back up.

901
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,510
We can just eliminate that by drawing
kind of a rectangle above the phone.

902
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,036
>> If we go to our square thing here.

903
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:20,290
And we go to this point, just kind of
draw a rectangle randomly in the sky,

904
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,040
and then make the other edge of it
be-- I'll just click over here--

905
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,850
make this point be
coincident with the circle.

906
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:31,190
Now when we extrude, we
can extrude the circle.

907
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,150
And by extrude, I mean extrude
cut-- extrude cut the circle

908
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,452
and this little sliver in here.

909
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:37,660
That might be a subtle point.

910
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,390
And in our case, it wouldn't
make a huge difference.

911
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,030
But it's nice to add all
these finishing details in it.

912
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,570
It distinguishes kind of a
quickly, hastily made product

913
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,020
and one that had a lot
of thought into it.

914
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:52,000
>> We'll click our green check mark here.

915
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,290
And we're good to go.

916
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,680
You'll notice that this is blue.

917
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,980
This is kind of an exception.

918
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,063
We don't really need to
define it here, because it

919
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:01,940
doesn't matter how
tall our rectangle is.

920
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,840
It will still accomplish the same task.

921
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:08,040
>> This is pretty rare that you don't
need to define something in a sketch.

922
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,120
In 99.9% of cases, you
need the whole sketch

923
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,140
to be black like I had mentioned before.

924
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,640
In this case, it doesn't matter.

925
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:18,880
We'll exit the sketch, again go to
Features, kind of this common theme

926
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,080
here, find the plane, Sketch, Extrude.

927
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,540
And we'll go to Extrude Cut.

928
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,250
>> And now, SolidWorks prompts us
to pick what we want to cut.

929
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,970
Let's select these bottom pieces.

930
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,808
And now, let's get these little slivers.

931
00:43:33,808 --> 00:43:36,550
We'll do it on the other side too.

932
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,160
Again, just zooming by
scrolling on the mouse.

933
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,120
Now we have everything we need.

934
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,419
>> We don't want to do Blind.

935
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:47,460
I guess we could do Blind, but it
doesn't really accomplish what we want.

936
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,310
Let's do Up To Next,
and that will only cut

937
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:54,640
through the first layer of material.

938
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,250
When we say we want to
cut up to next, that's

939
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,870
meaning we want to cut
everything up to the next face.

940
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,821
>> Well, the next face is
the layer behind here.

941
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:04,070
We don't want this Home cut
to go all the way through.

942
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,000
You don't need it to
go all the way through.

943
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,180
There's no Home button
on the back of the phone.

944
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:12,304
If we just hit the green check
here, now we have the phone cut out.

945
00:44:12,304 --> 00:44:15,470
Now we can start to add in the finishing
details, because we're almost done.

946
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,524
I mentioned before that
we can add in fillets,

947
00:44:17,524 --> 00:44:19,440
which make everything
look a little bit nicer.

948
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,740
These are super easy to do.

949
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,530
This is probably the easiest part
of this whole CADing process.

950
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:28,440
>> In our Feature Tree up here,
in this kind of tab pane,

951
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,390
we go to Features where we were hitting
Extrude Boss/Base and Extrude Cut

952
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:33,130
before.

953
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,220
A couple of options over, we have
this option to Fillet something.

954
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,600
Let's click on that.

955
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,500
All Fillet wants is an edge.

956
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,670
You can give it a face,
and it'll figure it out.

957
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,060
But it really is looking for edges
to which it can add a fillet.

958
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,920
>> I'd mentioned before that we want
to add a fillet to the back here.

959
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,765
If we just click on this edge,
it sketches out the fillet here,

960
00:44:51,765 --> 00:44:52,640
which is pretty cool.

961
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,550
That required minimal work on our part.

962
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,800
SolidWorks just defaults
to some arbitrary value

963
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,880
for the radius of this fillet.

964
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,520
It looks good.

965
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,300
We can make it a little bit bigger.

966
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,310
I just think it's
aesthetically more pleasing.

967
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,200
>> This is when it becomes kind of
less scientific and more aesthetic.

968
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,780
The radius here is set to 0.10 inches.

969
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,114
We could probably set it
to I don't know 0.15 maybe.

970
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,530
That makes it a little bit bigger.

971
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,613
That looks nicer, I think.

972
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:20,460
This is up to you.

973
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,059
This is kind of customization.

974
00:45:22,059 --> 00:45:23,350
So we hit the check mark there.

975
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,850
It adds in the fillet.

976
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:27,290
Looking good.

977
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:31,020
Now let's fillet this back edge here.

978
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,980
And what this is doing is that
first fillet that I added in

979
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,430
was this one right here.

980
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,360
We can also add in a fillet
to smooth this edge down.

981
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:46,150
>> Let's select again Fillet
and this back edge here.

982
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,610
And it does the same thing.

983
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:51,056
It's again defaulting to
0.15 inches, because that's

984
00:45:51,056 --> 00:45:52,180
what I'd entered last time.

985
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:59,970
That seems a little excessive
here-- maybe 0.075, half that.

986
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:01,740
That looks a little bit nicer.

987
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,210
Again, this is totally
up to the designer.

988
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,830
>> That looks a little better.

989
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,170
Maybe we can actually make
that a little bit larger.

990
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:12,900
I'm going to show you now how to
make an existing fillet larger.

991
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,350
And this is kind of
a theme in SolidWorks

992
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,180
where when you've
already made a feature,

993
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,020
you can change it pretty
easily, pretty painlessly.

994
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,640
>> Let's go through and label some
things that we have not labeled.

995
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,570
Cut Extrude 3, we don't know what
that is, so we just click on it.

996
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:30,370
And we see that it was the
cut for our Home button.

997
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,900
Let's just label that Home Button Hole.

998
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:40,450
The fillets are kind of a
tertiary feature, so to speak.

999
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,940
Labeling them is not as crucial.

1000
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:46,385
>> But you're looking at this and
you say oh my god, Ansel, my life

1001
00:46:46,385 --> 00:46:47,110
is falling apart.

1002
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,109
What do I do about that?

1003
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:51,030
And I say you need to change
the radius of this fillet.

1004
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,850
Let's click on it.

1005
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,391
And we're going to right click on it.

1006
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:54,660
And now, this option pops up.

1007
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,868
We have all of these options.

1008
00:46:55,868 --> 00:46:57,690
We can hide it, suppress it.

1009
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,850
>> The top left option is
this Edit Feature option.

1010
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,930
If we click on that, now we
return to the Feature pane

1011
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,820
which we had access to before.

1012
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,200
And we can change everything.

1013
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,490
>> We had set it to 0.075 inches before.

1014
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,880
Let's now maybe bump
that up a little bit.

1015
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,182
I think it will just look nicer-- 0.10.

1016
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:22,210
I accidentally added in a
zero in the wrong place.

1017
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,860
That looks pretty good, maybe 0.120.

1018
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,010
I think that looks pretty nice.

1019
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,490
This part is effectively done.

1020
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,550
It will do everything
that we want it to.

1021
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,990
It will hold the phone.

1022
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,680
It looks good.

1023
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,410
Yeah, it has a spot for the Home button.

1024
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:41,950
This is pretty much what
we wanted to accomplish.

1025
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,090
>> Some things that we
can think about are we

1026
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:47,590
need to be sure that the
center of the phone, the center

1027
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,820
mass of the phone, if looking vertically
will hover over this base and not

1028
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,480
kind of beyond it.

1029
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,600
As I had mentioned before, if that's
the case, the phone will fall over.

1030
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,930
I just kind of eyed it.

1031
00:47:57,930 --> 00:48:01,635
It might not hurt to just sketch it out
on paper using pretty simple geometry.

1032
00:48:01,635 --> 00:48:03,930
It's a super simple problem.

1033
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:09,060
>> I chose in this specific example to
add the letters CS50 in the front.

1034
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,831
You're welcome to add whatever
you want on the front.

1035
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:13,580
But one thing that I
will caution you with

1036
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:17,720
is that some 3D printers don't have
infinitely granular resolution.

1037
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,760
>> And by that I mean that if you write
really small text with a really

1038
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,430
small font, it's going to look
really kind of cloudy or blotchy.

1039
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,180
If you make a really big text,
the letters are really large,

1040
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,580
and it doesn't require a whole lot
of resolution on the 3D printer side,

1041
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,040
so it'll just look way better.

1042
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,430
So if you're printing
in text into something,

1043
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,450
definitely make it as large as possible.

1044
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:41,470
>> I'll just briefly show
you how to do that.

1045
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,780
If we highlight this face here,
you'll notice that we can,

1046
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,370
we'll sketch on it again.

1047
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,660
Let's look Normal to it.

1048
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,460
Hit Sketch, Sketch again.

1049
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,230
Instead of drawing a line or a
circle, there is this big A here.

1050
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,600
Some people call me Big A.

1051
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,440
>> We can hit that.

1052
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,580
And now we have the option
to add text on to something.

1053
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:06,140
Let's type in CS.

1054
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,052
You might be able to fit
CS50 all on one side.

1055
00:49:09,052 --> 00:49:10,510
It certainly wouldn't be symmetric.

1056
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,593
I don't think it would be
aesthetically appealing.

1057
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:16,320
So I did CS on one side
and 50 on the other.

1058
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,730
That was just a decision that
seemed to work at the time.

1059
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,420
>> We will hit the green arrow.

1060
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,630
Now we'll notice that
these letters are blue.

1061
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,260
And that's because they are
just floating around in space.

1062
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:33,250
They are kind of free to move wherever.

1063
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:39,520
What we want to do is, I'm actually
going to delete them by right clicking,

1064
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,470
just hitting Cancel.

1065
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,670
I'm sorry, right clicking
when you're not in a feature.

1066
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:46,280
And then hit Delete.

1067
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,811
>> We can do a nicer job in defining them.

1068
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:52,060
When you write text, and text is kind
of something that's a little bit weaker,

1069
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,880
you want to create a line that
the text will sit on, and then

1070
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,930
define the text to be kind
of adhering to that line.

1071
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:05,160
We do that by just
drawing a center line.

1072
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,600
>> Make sure that it is horizontal here.

1073
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,590
Double click to get out
of drawing the line.

1074
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,030
And then hit the green arrow.

1075
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,636
This line is just floating around here.

1076
00:50:15,636 --> 00:50:16,760
We have freedom to move it.

1077
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,900
Let's not define it just yet.

1078
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,020
Let's add the text in before
we set where it lives.

1079
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,880
>> Again, we'll go to this big A here.

1080
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,520
We'll hit CS.

1081
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,500
And then, it defaulted to this
Line 1 as where it will live on.

1082
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,870
But if that didn't exist,
we'll just delete this.

1083
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,720
You can kind of select the
line by just clicking on it.

1084
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,630
And SolidWorks knows
that you mean to put

1085
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,060
the text on the line
with the green arrow.

1086
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,040
Cool.

1087
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,100
>> Now the text is really
small so we can actually

1088
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,120
just double click on
it and edit the font.

1089
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,500

1090
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,700
And we do that.

1091
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,460
It defaults using the document
font, which we don't want to use,

1092
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,450
so we uncheck that.

1093
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,600
And now, this font box
becomes un-grayed out.

1094
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,950
It's at 12 point right now.

1095
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,790
Let's maybe bump it up to like 48.

1096
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,925
That looks pretty good.

1097
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:13,060
And you can hit the green arrow.

1098
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,470
>> And by moving where the line begins
around, you can move the text around.

1099
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:24,090
For example, you should be able to--
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit,

1100
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,040
select this point.

1101
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,373
You should be able to move that.

1102
00:51:26,373 --> 00:51:29,260
And you can see that
the text moves with it.

1103
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,480
>> You can do this, put the
text wherever you want.

1104
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,800
You can define it by
fixing this point, like so.

1105
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,730
And then, now our baseline
becomes blacked out, Exit that.

1106
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,415
The sketch still exists.

1107
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:49,329
You can go into the sketch like
I did before and extrude it.

1108
00:51:49,329 --> 00:51:51,120
We don't want it to go
all the way through.

1109
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:58,157
We only want it to go maybe,
I don't know, 0.05 inches in.

1110
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,990
You don't want it to
go all the way through,

1111
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,350
just because it won't look nice.

1112
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,610
Hit the green check.

1113
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:07,390
And now CS50 or the CS
part of CS50 is in there.

1114
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:07,890
Cool.

1115
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:11,470
Then you can do 50 on the other side.

1116
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:15,940
>> That's your total freedom as
to what you want to do there.

1117
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,547
You'll notice that I just
suppressed it in the Feature Tree.

1118
00:52:18,547 --> 00:52:20,380
If you have a feature
that's kind of causing

1119
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,950
problems with dimensions or something
is awry, you can suppress it.

1120
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:27,830
And it will kind of get rid of
that feature and everything that's

1121
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,090
referencing it or everything
associated with it.

1122
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:33,934
Just kind of a side note.

1123
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:36,850
Let's save this part, which I should
have done a long time ago in case

1124
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,050
my computer crashed.

1125
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:42,540
We can just go to File, Save As.

1126
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,020
I'll just save it on my desktop.

1127
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,330
We'll call this iPhone Dock.

1128
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:51,600
And it saves is a part.

1129
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,730
>> Once that you have created
a part, we encourage

1130
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:59,020
you to use 3D printing as a means by
which you're able to manufacture it.

1131
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:02,830
If you're interested in more
sophisticated methods of manufacture,

1132
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:06,770
do look into ES51, which is Computer
Aided Machine Design, because that's

1133
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:11,610
kind of a more exhaustive course
long, semester long introduction

1134
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,530
to more sophisticated
manufacture methods,

1135
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,110
like using a mill to
make it out of metal.

1136
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,110
But we're not as concerned
about that right now.

1137
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:20,662
This is a pretty simple part.

1138
00:53:20,662 --> 00:53:22,870
And it's going to be plenty
strong by 3D printing it.

1139
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:26,320
>> Now, before it can be
given to the 3D printer,

1140
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,380
we need to do a little bit of handiwork
that makes it in a file format

1141
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,430
that the 3D printer will play with.

1142
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:37,930
We can do that by using
MakerBot's own software,

1143
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,960
and just import this and then
create it into a dot MakerBot file.

1144
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:45,900
And we do that by exporting
this as a dot STL file.

1145
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,940
>> If we go over here, we
can hit File, Save As.

1146
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:54,375
The default is to save it as SolidWorks'
own extension, which for [INAUDIBLE]

1147
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:58,540
is dot-- I don't even know-- SLDPRT.

1148
00:53:58,540 --> 00:53:59,440
We don't want that.

1149
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,550
If we had this drop down, we
can change the format to STL.

1150
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,915
And we'll say again, we'll
save it on the desktop.

1151
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:12,060

1152
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,690
>> Let's go-- I'm actually just
going to save in my Dropbox

1153
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:21,820
so that I can easily access it in
my Mac partition on my computer.

1154
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,600
But you're welcome to do
whatever-- iPhone Doc.

1155
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,399
We'll hit Save.

1156
00:54:25,399 --> 00:54:26,940
It'll give us this little prompt box.

1157
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,773
It's like, do you want
to save it as an STL?

1158
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:30,660
And you're like, hell,
yeah, so you hit Yes.

1159
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:39,910
>> Then I'm going to just jump over
to Mac here and go into my Dropbox.

1160
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:44,090
I'm going to [INAUDIBLE] my CSP set
up that I'm diligently working on,

1161
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:51,010
go to Dropbox, and I should see it here.

1162
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,280
Cool-- iphonedoc.stl.

1163
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,130
Just drag it on my desktop.

1164
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:57,730
>> I'm going to fire up
the MakerBot software.

1165
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:02,470
And by doing so, I will
just import the file

1166
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:05,620
that we just made in a dot STL format.

1167
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:10,740
And then from there, we'll create
the dot MakerBot file format.

1168
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:13,820
It kind of gives you what the
printing stage looks like.

1169
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,940
>> Let's just that are
part file to it, which

1170
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:22,420
we do by saying Add File, kind of in the
upper-right menu over here, Add File.

1171
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,830
I'm going to put it on
my desktop-- iPhone Doc.

1172
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,054
Hit Open.

1173
00:55:27,054 --> 00:55:28,970
Do you want to put the
object on the platform?

1174
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:29,670
Yes, I do.

1175
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,604
So it says, I say move to platform.

1176
00:55:31,604 --> 00:55:33,270
This is in a really weird configuration.

1177
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,840
We don't want it to print like this.

1178
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,220
It'll take forever and it
will be really unstable.

1179
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,350
We want to print in a
really stable configuration.

1180
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:43,300
And by that I mean, we
want to have it print

1181
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,690
with kind of this face on the bottom.

1182
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:48,840
And then, start it from the
bottom, work our way to the top.

1183
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,969
We'll do that by rotating
this part 90 degrees.

1184
00:55:51,969 --> 00:55:54,010
If we select the part,
and you can know that it's

1185
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,060
selected because it's outlined
in yellow, hit Turn here.

1186
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,230
A little menu will pop up.

1187
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:03,360
And I believe we want to turn
it-- nope, that's not right--

1188
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,231
turn it 90 degrees in
I guess it's the x way.

1189
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:08,230
You can just play around
until you get it right.

1190
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,330
Then hit Lay Flat,
and that will bring it

1191
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:14,214
down to the bottom of
the build platform.

1192
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:16,870
I don't need to rotate it.

1193
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,600
>> And now, we are actually ready to print.

1194
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,630
It was that simple.

1195
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,600
If you want to kind of in a
more sophisticated setting,

1196
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:25,090
you can adjust some of
the print parameters.

1197
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,995
Infill just means how much of what's
being printed is actual filament

1198
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:31,670
and how much is air.

1199
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:36,480
>> For example, 100% infill mean that
this is a completely solid part.

1200
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,510
Whereas 10% infill, which I guess is
MakerBot's default, means that only 10%

1201
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:45,380
of this volume is going to be filament,
and the remaining 90% will be air.

1202
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,920
And it's able to maintain most
of the structural integrity

1203
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,150
by creating a honeycomb that
MakerBot figures out on their own.

1204
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,856
They have an algorithm built into
this program that takes care of that.

1205
00:56:55,856 --> 00:56:57,356
We'll just leave all these settings.

1206
00:56:57,356 --> 00:56:58,970
I'll say Save Settings.

1207
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,701
And now, we're going
to Export Print File.

1208
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:02,200
Cool.

1209
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,075
And it's ready to go.

1210
00:57:03,075 --> 00:57:06,660
It says it'll take about an
hour and a half for it to print.

1211
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,970
You can probably a little bit of
work done while it's printing.

1212
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,310
>> We can hit this Print Preview.

1213
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:12,684
It's just kind of a cool feature.

1214
00:57:12,684 --> 00:57:17,200
And this allows us to get an
idea of how it will print.

1215
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,580
3D printing is done by kind of
adding one layer on top of another.

1216
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,920
So if we see over on the
left side of our window here,

1217
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,440
there it says Layer 83.

1218
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,110
>> There's a little slider that allows
us to kind of scan through our part.

1219
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,090
If we scan through
here, you can actually

1220
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,070
see the honeycomb that it prints.

1221
00:57:35,070 --> 00:57:37,280
You can kind of see that's
kind of hard to see here.

1222
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,380
It may be a little
better if we look on top.

1223
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:42,124
MakerBot figured all
that out on their own.

1224
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:44,040
They have an algorithm
that took care of that.

1225
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,600
We didn't design that honeycomb in.

1226
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,840
That just makes it a more
efficient print process.

1227
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:55,220
>> The high-level takeaways for this
are you design the part, prepare it,

1228
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,910
in this case, where you can
print on a MakerBot 3D printer,

1229
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:03,240
but you're welcome to use something
of the like that is not MakerBot.

1230
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,590
Prepare it in their
software, and then give it

1231
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:09,820
to the 3D printer on maybe the network
or on a flash drive in the correct file

1232
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:10,850
format.

1233
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:15,092
And then from there, you have
your part and you're ready to go.

1234
00:58:15,092 --> 00:58:17,050
The way that you can do
this, and you'll notice

1235
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:20,940
that I use kind of a lot of
different software packages on here,

1236
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,250
I happen to have SolidWorks
installed on my computer.

1237
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,535
But it's not a free product.

1238
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,410
Definitely if you're a
member of the college,

1239
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,040
you might not want to go
through the strain of it

1240
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,270
runs on Windows, kind
of downloading Windows,

1241
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:35,060
having to get your hands on the
software, which can be a pain.

1242
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,025
>> If you want to do something like
this or pursue a mechanical component

1243
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:42,320
to your project, definitely
utilize the computer workstations

1244
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,290
in the basement of Pierce
Hall in G11 specifically,

1245
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:47,550
as they are open nearly
around the clock.

1246
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:50,040
And they have all of the
software that you need.

1247
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:54,580
They have SolidWorks and they are
very powerful with fun large monitors,

1248
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,600
so it will make [INAUDIBLE]
pretty easy for you.

1249
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,680
They're very quick.

1250
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:03,032
>> Once you're done with that, you can
actually download the MakerBot software

1251
00:59:03,032 --> 00:59:04,240
package on your own computer.

1252
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:04,910
It's free.

1253
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:09,040
And I believe they do have both
Mac and Windows versions of it.

1254
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,720
And then from there, you're good to go.

1255
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:18,400
Utilize Pierce, SolidWorks,
export it, MakerBot, print it.

1256
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,710
>> Try to add in relations
as much as you can,

1257
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,910
so that you don't have to
add redundant dimensions.

1258
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:23,670
That's important.

1259
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:27,100
It might not be a big player in
a pretty simple part like this,

1260
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:30,470
but it's just kind of a
good practice definitely.

1261
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,850
And if interested in doing this on
kind of a more intricate level, a more

1262
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,550
granular level, definitely
look into taking ES51.

1263
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,160

1264
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,420
>> That about concludes it.

1265
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,350
I hope you have enjoyed listening to me.

1266
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:45,550
And if you have any questions,
don't hesitate to shoot me an email.

1267
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:48,300
I believe that my email is
attached to the invitation

1268
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,620
of this event in some way.

1269
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:51,390
Thank you.

1270
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:54,475
