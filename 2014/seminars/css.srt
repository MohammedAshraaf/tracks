1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,500
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,099

4
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:12,224
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: So
we're basically just going

5
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,629
to give you a rundown
of CSS, because we know

6
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:16,420
that it wasn't covered
in all the sections.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,090
And we really want to make sure that you
guys have this tool at your disposal,

8
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,790
because it has the ability to make
your websites look much prettier.

9
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,660
>> And if you're building a website, then
you probably want to make it pretty.

10
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,372
I mean, you don't have to,
but I'd suggest it. [LAUGHS]

11
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:35,430
If you want users to use it, you might
want to make it a little [INAUDIBLE].

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,130
So we're going to try and give you just
some basic tools and understanding,

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:42,340
so that when you go out and you're
researching things about CSS,

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,902
it's not complete gibberish,
like CSS sometimes to be.

15
00:00:45,902 --> 00:00:47,240
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,930
Allison said it pretty well.

17
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,250
So I guess the first thing we
should start with is what is CSS?

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,750
So CSS is awesome.

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,250
CSS--

20
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,320
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: That's
the name of our seminar.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,434
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

22
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,130
It's really important that
you understand that by then.

23
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,090
If you only take away one
thing, it's that CSS if awesome.

24
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,180
Two is CSS stands for
Cascading Style Sheets.

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,380
So at its core, CSS is
a style sheet, meaning

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,200
it allows you to style a web page.

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,609
And then what that means, it's a
way to add style to your websites.

28
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,900
So by style, we mean everything
that's not structural--

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,350
so things like colors, background
images, borders, like, padding,

30
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,040
margins.

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,310
We'll talk about what
all that means in a bit.

32
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,110
>> So we've just gone ahead and
opened both of those up in gedit.

33
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,680
So this is index.HTML.

34
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,800
And this is main.css.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,829
So main.css has nothing.

36
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,412
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: No style so far.

37
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:39,245
TOMAS REIMERS: None.

38
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:42,577
And as you'll see, it's
a really ugly site.

39
00:01:42,577 --> 00:01:44,160
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: It's just plain.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,820
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

41
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,150
Yeah, it's not ugly,
it's just minimalist.

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:53,430
And then here we have index.html.

43
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,729
And so for a quick
recap of HTML, Allison,

44
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,270
you want to just talk about the page?

45
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,395
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah.

46
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:01,100
So obviously, we have our HTML
tag, which just names HTML file.

47
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,080
We have our header here, with CSS
Awesomeness, which-- if you go back.

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,720
Where is that?

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,136
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Oh.

50
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,301
Yeah, you can see.

51
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,092
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
And notice the header

52
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:14,120
is this tab header right up here.

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,130
And then "Hello, world!" is
the text that we have just

54
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,620
displaying on the web
page, which is-- go back.

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,290
Back.

56
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:24,287
Which is just in our body
here-- the plain text.

57
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,120
Also, one thing to
notice, if you look here,

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,410
Tomas switched up these
two from our slide.

59
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,035
So as long as you have all
three of these, you're fine.

60
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,044
They can be in whatever order they want.

61
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:39,368
What's most important is just that
you have each of those three things.

62
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:40,340
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Cool.

63
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,111
Add a doc type?

64
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:42,235
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah.

65
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,068
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

66
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:43,769
Cool.

67
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:46,102
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Apparently,
my mics don't like me.

68
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:49,650
TOMAS REIMERS: Oh, give us a sec just
while Allison switches out her mic.

69
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,500
So yeah.

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,030
So we have our main page.

71
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,890
It's kind of unstyled.

72
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,780
We don't have much.

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,110
We just have basically text.

74
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,470
We have the style sheet.

75
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,220
We have the title.

76
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,020
So just bare-boned
components make a website.

77
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,880
>> So from there, let's
talk about what CSS is

78
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,270
and what it looks like and all of that.

79
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,047
So for that--

80
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:13,755
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Back to the slides.

81
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:15,200
TOMAS REIMERS: Back to the slides.

82
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,240
And Allison can take over.

83
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,720
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Woo.

84
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,220
OK.

85
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,360
So in your CSS file,
you're going to have

86
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,010
a lot of these things called selectors.

87
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,420
That will just be the
basis of your CSS file.

88
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,480
It's just going to be
lots and lots of these.

89
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,780
So selector.

90
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,649
This is just the general anatomy.

91
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:35,190
We're going to go through
examples, because if you guys never

92
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,400
watched my section, I feel
like things in the abstract

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
don't really make sense.

94
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,110
It always helps to see the examples.

95
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,420
>> So we have some selector.

96
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,120
That's going to be some identifier for
what we want the style to apply to.

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,220
And then we can have any
set of rules and values.

98
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,680
So selectors that you might see
might be something like body,

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,262
or paragraph with P,
or header, or whatever,

100
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:02,000
whatever you want your HTML tags to be.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,570
>> So in this case, we have body.

102
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,985
And we have some rule,
which this corresponds

103
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,610
to what your style applies to.

104
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,720
So in this case, we have
background color and font weight.

105
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,200
So this is going to change
the background of anything

106
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,640
within any body tag of our HTML file.

107
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,810
And it's going to give
it this light blue value.

108
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,820
>> So it's going to make the
background light blue.

109
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,660
And then anything within body is
going to have a font weight bold.

110
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,142
So it's just going to
bold all of our text.

111
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,970
And this is just one selector.

112
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,680
But you could have very many of these.

113
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,730
And as we're going to show
later, a little bit more into how

114
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,709
that works and more examples there.

115
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:41,750
Anything you want to add?

116
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,499
>> TOMAS REIMERS: No.

117
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,500
Allison got it.

118
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,144
We're just going to cut up an
example here on our example site.

119
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,310
So let's actually take this.

120
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,620
It's perfect.

121
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,460
So I'm just going to copy and paste
that right into our main.css file.

122
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,530
And I'm going to save it.

123
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,190
And then we will run it.

124
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,600
So side note, one of the
most frustrating things

125
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,490
is if you don't save a file, and
then you, like, reload the page,

126
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,450
and like, why isn't
the change happening?

127
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,950
It happens.

128
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,230
So here we saw that we made our
website a light blue background

129
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,560
and some bolded text.

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,730
>> I should also mention, if you
guys have questions about anything

131
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,622
we're doing, please feel
free to stop us and ask us.

132
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,330
We're totally willing
to field questions.

133
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,951

134
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:31,930
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Obviously, with
CSS, everything builds upon itself.

135
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,107
So if one thing doesn't
make sense now, we

136
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,690
don't want that to bog you down later.

137
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,390

138
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,930
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So let's
kind of dissect this.

139
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,210
So do you want to start
with the selector here?

140
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,979
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah.

141
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,270
As I was saying before, body
is just our selector here.

142
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,950
So if we go back over to our index-- ah.

143
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,245
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Which I just closed.

144
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,530
Give me a second.

145
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,286
So File, Open, index.html.

146
00:05:58,286 --> 00:05:59,410
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Cool.

147
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,710
So if you notice here, we
have these body tags, right?

148
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,270
So the selector just corresponds to
the tags that we're talking about.

149
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,670
So body right here.

150
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,315
So what we're saying is
everything-- can we go back?

151
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,065
I wish I could just
like touch the screen.

152
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:14,410
It'd be so much cooler.

153
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,150
>> So anything within those
body tags, which we saw

154
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,637
was just, like, the text,
and the body in general

155
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:20,970
refers to, like, the background.

156
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,720
If you ever want to
change the background,

157
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,090
that's going to be in a body tag.

158
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,120
Just has these rules applied to them.

159
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,040
>> So if we were to go to
index.html and-- actually,

160
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,840
can we have something
outside of the body?

161
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,340
If we had, like, a footer or
something, it wouldn't apply to this.

162
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,900
But anything within
these body tags is going

163
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,960
to be affected by this body
selector that we've made.

164
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,405
So if you were to type
something else there--

165
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:49,400
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Let's drive that home.

166
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,330
So if we had a div-- so that's
just another tag you can have.

167
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,350
I'm going to close it.

168
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,280
Or let's make this a paragraph.

169
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,430
So p stands for paragraph.

170
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,560
And within that paragraph.

171
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,650
And then I say, "This is text."

172
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,369
Cool.

173
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,160
And then I made this rule apply to
a paragraph instead of the body.

174
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,390

175
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:17,320
You'll see how it applies only to
the newly formed paragraph, right,

176
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,892
not the whole thing.

177
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:20,090
Does that make sense?

178
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,840
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
So this is all body,

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,450
but now our selector just
corresponds to the paragraph.

180
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,050
So we just have bold and blue
for this specific paragraph,

181
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,760
because this is the only thing
that is enclosed within the p tag.

182
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,349
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Does that make sense sort
of how things encapsulate other things?

183
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,140
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Also, just
to say, like, one of the best ways

184
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,889
to really get comfortable with CSS
is to just do things like this,

185
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,050
just try it out.

186
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,700
It's very simple to type something
out, hit Refresh, and see what happens.

187
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,940
And as with most CS,
experimentation can often

188
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,790
lead to a much better
intuitive understanding.

189
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,432
Even more so than us just,
like, talking to you.

190
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,350
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Absolutely
100% agree on that point.

191
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,430
So if we go back to this, let's start
dissecting exactly what these two do.

192
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,550
So we have two rules on this.

193
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,420
So the first one is background color.

194
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,590
And you see that we've set it
equal to a value, light blue.

195
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,009
>> So in CSS, CSS is sort
of very loose about how

196
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:16,300
you're allowed to define color.

197
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,800
So you can define them by name.

198
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,650
You can also do something like "red."

199
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,270
And then if we go back to this,
you'll see that the background is red.

200
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,040
You can also get really-- I think you
can get pretty creative with this,

201
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,540
can't you?

202
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,170
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I
think you can use hex.

203
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,250
Can't you?

204
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,083
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

205
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:32,969
So you can use hex.

206
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:34,490
But I'm thinking name-wise.

207
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,385
Aren't there?

208
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:37,260
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
You can do quite a few.

209
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,350
Pretty much like most colors that you
can name-- like, I think salmon is one.

210
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,322
>> TOMAS REIMERS: We're gonna try salmon.

211
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,530
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I
think chartreuse is in there.

212
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,050
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

213
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,550
See?

214
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,080
So you can get pretty creative.

215
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,246
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: You
could get pretty creative.

216
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:55,750
Like, if you can think of the
color name, it's probably in there.

217
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,840
If you really want fine
detail, you can go hex.

218
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,673
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

219
00:08:58,673 --> 00:08:59,390
So hexadecimal.

220
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,280
If you guys remember this back
from your old PSET, Image Recover,

221
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,300
you guys had to deal
with these hex values.

222
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,280
And sort of to recap what that is,
hex has three values stored in it.

223
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,250
So it's in groups of two increments.

224
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,300
The first two represent the red value.

225
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,420
The second one represents
the green value.

226
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,020
And the last one is blue?

227
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,050
>> So FF happens to represent
a hexadecimal 255.

228
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,480
So you have 255 red, 255
green, and 0 for blue.

229
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,670
And values range between 0 and 255.

230
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,350
>> AUDIENCE: Right.

231
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,472
So essentially, we could search
the internet for any color we want,

232
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:43,912
and identify the actually-known
color spectrum combo,

233
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:45,130
and then we could put it in?

234
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,380
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Exactly.

235
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,900
So you have pretty much complete control
over the colors you want within CSS.

236
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,069
Are we going to talk about
background images later?

237
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:56,110
Or do we want to do that?

238
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,240
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

239
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,010
Absolutely.

240
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,830
So first, just to show that
red and green is yellow.

241
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,120
And if you need some
help finding this, you

242
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,575
can Google something
like "color picker."

243
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:07,200
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Oh, it's so good.

244
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,090
I love Color Picker.

245
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,360
>> TOMAS REIMERS: colorpicker.com
is a good example.

246
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,580
And here, you'll see that you have
a full Photoshop-like color picker.

247
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,920
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Mm-hm.

248
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,980
Also, the cool things are you
can generate color schemes

249
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,896
so that you don't have,
like, clashing colors.

250
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:22,780
TOMAS REIMERS: And then
here's the hex value up here.

251
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,800
So you can always find online basically
places to get the hex value from.

252
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,667
It's not sort of that just, like, we
see the colors of the world in numbers.

253
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:34,000
It's more that we go online
and find what color we want,

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,850
and then take the number down.

255
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,590
Because it's just a really easy
way to reference things in CS.

256
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,350
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
And then there's also--

257
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,630
I forget the exact name of the site.

258
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,838
But there's definitely, I
think, something from Adobe

259
00:10:43,838 --> 00:10:48,350
that generates color schemes for you,
which is really cool, because you

260
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,580
definitely-- it's sometimes
hard to figure out,

261
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,729
oh, if I want to use this color,
what might be another useful one

262
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,395
to use elsewhere on my site to,
like, make it nice and cohesive.

263
00:10:56,395 --> 00:11:00,430

264
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,260
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Allison's talking about
one by Adobe called Kuler, I think.

265
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:04,885
It's K-U-L-E-R.

266
00:11:04,885 --> 00:11:06,259
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I think so.

267
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:07,610
I'm pretty sure that's the one.

268
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,050
>> TOMAS REIMERS: My favorite has
always been Color Scheme Designer.

269
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,998
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Ooh.

270
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,010
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Which is now--

271
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,860
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Ah, this is beautiful.

272
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,818
>> TOMAS REIMERS: And you
can basically say, like,

273
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:21,700
I want three colors next to each other.

274
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,030
And then let's do something nice.

275
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,210
And then you can get an example
of what that might look like.

276
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,470
And then if you hover over any of
them, it gives you the hex value.

277
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,010
>> So just as a good way to start
thinking about color schemes

278
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,570
or what colors in a website
might go well together.

279
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,655
Because that can be surprisingly
not as easy to pick as you think.

280
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:48,280
And then the other cool thing
I've always found about this site

281
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,480
is if you hit Examples, it'll
show what an example website

282
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,800
might look like using that color scheme.

283
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,270
Anyway.

284
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,863
>> Back to the actual CSS.

285
00:11:57,863 --> 00:12:01,112
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: But obviously, we
know these references might be useful.

286
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:03,195
TOMAS REIMERS: No, they
definitely can be helpful.

287
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:04,720
So the second rule, Allison?

288
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,844
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah.

289
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:08,280
The second rule is just
corresponding to our font.

290
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,520
So font weight is just kind
of-- so the weight would

291
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,220
be if you want just, like,
normal or, like, thinner fonts,

292
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,251
or in this case, like, bold.

293
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:17,750
I forget.

294
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,557
What's the if you wanted it-- is there
a thinner one than just, like, normal?

295
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:24,140
TOMAS REIMERS: I don't actually
know if there's a thinner one.

296
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,680
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I forget.

297
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,300
So font weight we typically
just use for bold.

298
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,010
If you want to get really into
it, we're going to show you.

299
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,317
W3Schools has all the different
things you can do for fonts.

300
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,900
But basically, if you ever want
to change anything about font,

301
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,330
it's always going to be,
like, font-something.

302
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,450
So it'll be like, font-family if you're
trying to change the actual type.

303
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,390
It'll be font-style if you
want to make it like cursive,

304
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,710
or italics, or whatnot.

305
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,570
Or even font-color, if
we wanted to change that.

306
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,621
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yup.

307
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:56,925
So you can change that.

308
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,360
And sort of just to
recap now, so you can

309
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,400
see that we have the selector up here.

310
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
We have these curly braces.

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,735
And then we have rules
delimited by semicolons.

312
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,100
Does that make sense?

313
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,130
Yeah?

314
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,500
Cool.

315
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,200
So if that is good--

316
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,424
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Back.

317
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:17,590
TOMAS REIMERS: Let's talk specifically
about what kind of selectors we have.

318
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,790
'Cause right now we've
sort of just shown tags.

319
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,696
But you guys could see it plausible.

320
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:23,570
Say you have two paragraphs
on a page and you

321
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,087
want to be able to style
one but not the other,

322
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:29,170
you don't just want to limit yourself
to have to use different actual HTML

323
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,410
tags to give them different styles.

324
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,995
>> So we have three basic
types of selectors.

325
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,120
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah.

326
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,828
So we have tag, which is what
we've been talking about right now.

327
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:42,430
So that's kind of like your body or p.

328
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,280
And then we have class, which is
when we define it in our CSS file,

329
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,907
it's always going to be dot, whatever
you want the name of your class to be.

330
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,490
And this can apply to multiple things.

331
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,610

332
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,610
>> Say you have five paragraphs
and two of the three of them

333
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,580
need to be styled the same,
you would apply a class to it.

334
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,040
And this is just the way we do it.

335
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,600
We'll give you an example of
where this actually shows up.

336
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,030
But if you had maybe some tag
p, after it, you would write,

337
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,170
class equals whatever classes
you want to apply to it.

338
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,280
So whatever class selectors that we want
to apply to this specific paragraph,

339
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,300
we could just write like this.

340
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,080
Of course, I think an example
will make it much more concrete.

341
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,270
>> The other one we have
is id, which we denote

342
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,707
with a hash, or pound, or hashtag.

343
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:30,790
TOMAS REIMERS: Octothorpe.

344
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,430
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Octothorpe.

345
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,550
That works, too.

346
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,640
And this one should really be unique.

347
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,880
They should only apply to
one thing on your page.

348
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,820
So whether that's a specific paragraph,
or some item in a list, or whatever,

349
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,090
this should be unique.

350
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,730
And in the same way that we just
say, like, class= "class1 class2,"

351
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,577
this can just be id of whatever we have.

352
00:14:51,577 --> 00:14:52,410
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

353
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,330
So let's definitely talk
about examples here.

354
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,170
And I'm just going to dive
straight back into the code.

355
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:02,090
So let's look at our HTML.

356
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,960
And so we right now have one paragraph.

357
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,510
This is text.

358
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,151
I'm just going to modify
it. "This is text 1."

359
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:11,150
And then we're going to
have a "This is text 2."

360
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,525
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Second one.

361
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:13,540
TOMAS REIMERS: Yup.

362
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,810
So we now have "This is text 2," right?

363
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,560
And we're going to see that if we reload
the page, what we're going to find

364
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,067
is we're gonna find--

365
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,150
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Ooh.

366
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,983
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

367
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,570
We're going to find a "This is
text 1," and "This is text 2."

368
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,650
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: And
out lovely yellow color.

369
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,066
>> TOMAS REIMERS: And you'll see
that our selector right now,

370
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:34,940
which applies to p's, or
paragraphs, affects both of them,

371
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,700
because both of them meet the
condition that they're both a p tag.

372
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,360
That makes total sense.

373
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,340
So the question is, well, what
if we wanted to only get one?

374
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,350
So exactly like Allison was saying,
we have two other ways to do that.

375
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,320
I'm going to start with id.

376
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,405
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Let's start with id.

377
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,405
>> TOMAS REIMERS: And both
of these are attributes.

378
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:53,200
So attributes exist in HTML.

379
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,600
And what they are is
something that you add

380
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,840
inside the tag which is
separate from the tag name.

381
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,301
So you can have multiple attributes.

382
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:01,800
Yeah?

383
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,950
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I was just going
to say, from your example from PSET 7,

384
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,650
if any of you try to align
things to the center,

385
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,550
you might have used
"text align= center."

386
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,550
And you noticed it probably
should have centered

387
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,650
your text or your navigation bar.

388
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,499
So that's just also an attribute
that you might be familiar with.

389
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,040
TOMAS REIMERS: There's a bunch
of attributes that you'll see.

390
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,539
Yeah.

391
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:21,250
Like good reference to PSET 7.

392
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,150
We have id.

393
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,080
You can also have
class, things like this.

394
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,250
A single tag can have many attributes.

395
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,140
So starting with id, let's pretend we
want to have an id of-- I don't know.

396
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
We'll call it special,
because this one, we're

397
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,867
going to make bold, and
underline, and whatever.

398
00:16:37,867 --> 00:16:39,950
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: It's
gonna be super special.

399
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,360
TOMAS REIMERS: So this
one, we have id special.

400
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,140
So the way to select that, then, is
in main.css, rather than have a p tag,

401
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,500
you do #special, OK?

402
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,538
And that selects the
thing with id special.

403
00:16:55,538 --> 00:16:57,295
Does this make sense to everyone?

404
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:57,920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

405
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,110
TOMAS REIMERS: Cool.

406
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,440
So now if we go back,
we'll see-- whoops.

407
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,240
Yeah.

408
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,460
We'll see that it only selects
the one with id special.

409
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,622
Yeah?

410
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:11,900
Sounds cool.

411
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,570
Yes.

412
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,456
>> AUDIENCE: Can something have an
attribute of both class and an id?

413
00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:16,359
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yes.

414
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:16,900
AUDIENCE: OK.

415
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,887
And then what happens if you then give
it some rules in CSS that conflict?

416
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:21,970
TOMAS REIMERS: Absolutely.

417
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,940
We're definitely going
to talk about that.

418
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:31,890
So exactly what you were getting
at, you can also have classes.

419
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,380
So let's pretend I had
three paragraphs and I

420
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,730
wanted to style the first
two but not the third.

421
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,850
Well, your first idea may be, well, I
could just give the second one an id.

422
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,590
But you can't, because an id,
exactly like Allison was saying,

423
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,330
has to be unique.

424
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,860
>> So instead of an id, what you
can use is you can use a class.

425
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:57,880
And a class-- what it allows
you to do is basically say,

426
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,610
this belongs as part of a group.

427
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,410
In this case, our group
is called Special.

428
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:06,500
And what we're going to do then is
we're going to say-- rather than pound,

429
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,070
we're going to use dot.

430
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,740
OK?

431
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,950
And notice that the pound and dot
only exist within the CSS file,

432
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,797
not within the HTML.

433
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:13,880
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yes.

434
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,185
Important distinction.

435
00:18:15,185 --> 00:18:17,510
>> TOMAS REIMERS: I have
had so much struggle,

436
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:23,990
because I put the hash in the HTML and
then just felt stupid for a long time.

437
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,470
See how it selects both of
the ones with that class?

438
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,210
Cool.

439
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,950
>> Now, things can have multiple classes.

440
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,790
Let's say I wanted to make the first
two have a background of yellow

441
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,770
and the second two have
a font color of blue.

442
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,270
OK.

443
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,735
I don't really know why I'd
want to do that, but I can.

444
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:42,401
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Might not
recommended it for your website.

445
00:18:42,401 --> 00:18:43,880
But for our purposes, it'll do.

446
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,294
>> TOMAS REIMERS: It's not
a good color scheme.

447
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:49,210
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Well, yellow
and blue are my high school colors.

448
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,947
I don't know, though.

449
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:53,530
TOMAS REIMERS: Allison's high
school had a great color scheme.

450
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,520
[LAUGHTER]

451
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,120
So then what we can call this is
let's call this-- so we have Special

452
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,030
and we have Pretty.

453
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,405
I suggest, for this, you use
much more descriptive names.

454
00:19:02,405 --> 00:19:05,820
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah, I would
call this, like, yellow or blue.

455
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,314
>> TOMAS REIMERS: We're not
really making a real website,

456
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,730
which is why we're not doing that.

457
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,521
But if you actually
had a real website, you

458
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:16,220
might have, like, article header,
article content, first word,

459
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,920
things like that, which allow
you to be much more descriptive.

460
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,550
These are really just like variables.

461
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,390
They should be named in a way where
you can, like-- yeah, as such.

462
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,470
Perfect.

463
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,480
>> So background color.

464
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,920
And then we're going to say-- so the
way to change color is just "color."

465
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,412
And we're going to make it blue.

466
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,150
That's cool.

467
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,640
So now we have the
first two have special.

468
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,972
Next one's going to
have "class= pretty."

469
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:49,180
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: And then you'll
want to add "pretty" to the middle one.

470
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,971
TOMAS REIMERS: Yup.

471
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:52,970
And then to the middle one,
to add "pretty," what happens

472
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,880
is you just have a space.

473
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,800
So the class attribute
is a space-separated list

474
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,450
of all the classes
that apply to that tag.

475
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:02,959
OK?

476
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,750
It's not like this one belongs to
some kind of special class called

477
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,180
"special, space, pretty."

478
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,870
It belongs to two classes--
special and pretty.

479
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,492
Yes?

480
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,360
Cool.

481
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,010
>> And then if we look
at what happens, we're

482
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,850
going to see that first one has
yellow background, black text.

483
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:22,450
Second one--

484
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:26,160
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: --has bold
yellow background with blue text.

485
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,330
And our last one just has the
blue text that we assigned to it.

486
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,870
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Cool?

487
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,491
How selectors work?

488
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:32,990
Awesome.

489
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,720
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Do we want to
talk about the conflict now then?

490
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,780
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So yeah.

491
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,310
Absolutely.

492
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,380
So what happens if you
have a conflict, right?

493
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,740
Let's pretend the first one
sets up something like--

494
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,240
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Maybe
this one changes the background?

495
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,090
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

496
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,699
So we're going to make "pretty"
change the background to salmon.

497
00:20:51,699 --> 00:20:54,740
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: You're just with
all the great colors today, Tomas.

498
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,573
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

499
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:58,200
Because I found out I can
use salmon as a real color.

500
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,270
So we're only going to do that.

501
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,770
I also think Sunset is a real color.

502
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,103
AUDIENCE: Sunset's a real color?

503
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,572
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Let's try it.

504
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:07,735
TOMAS REIMERS: After this demo
just because in case it messes up,

505
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:08,943
I don't want to be debugging.

506
00:21:08,943 --> 00:21:11,580
So we know salmon's a real color.

507
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,626
So any guesses on
what's going to happen?

508
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:17,522
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Any idea?

509
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:20,002
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

510
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:20,920
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

511
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,150
So you got it exactly right.

512
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,930
Basically, it takes the
last rule that it was given.

513
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,860
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: So this is
where cascading comes into effect.

514
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,080
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So remember how we
had that cascading style sheets?

515
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,660
So by that, we kind of mean
that we have a bunch of rules

516
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,115
which apply on top of each other, and
they can also override each other.

517
00:21:37,115 --> 00:21:39,380
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: So
whatever's at the bottom

518
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,540
will override whatever's at the top.

519
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,842
You could have rules that completely
negate something beforehand.

520
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:48,300
That's also why you want to be
careful when you're styling,

521
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,465
so you're not creating rules that
you're just completely overriding.

522
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:53,340
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Or maybe you
do want to overwrite rules.

523
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:53,920
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Or maybe you do.

524
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,300
Yes.

525
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,175
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Pretend you have a
class which applies to most things,

526
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:01,220
but let's say you want to change the
background color to red and the font

527
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,140
weight to bold for most
things, but for one,

528
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,098
you only want the background color
to be red but you want all the other

529
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:09,990
properties, you could do something
like "font-weight= normal,"

530
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,760
which would then undo that bold change.

531
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,480
Yeah?

532
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,250
Again, the best way, I think
Allison said it, is just practice.

533
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,080
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Experimentation.

534
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,090
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Practice, practice,
practice, and experiment.

535
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,950
I know a lot of people that think
CSS is just a lot of guess-and-check

536
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,580
at the end of the day, where if
you want to do something-- like,

537
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,663
you have a rough idea, but
you still probably need

538
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:31,390
to try it out to make sure
you know what it looks like.

539
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,482
>> AUDIENCE: When you're applying
classes, more than one

540
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:37,339
to the same paragraph
or section, does it

541
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,505
matter what order you can
type them into the quotes?

542
00:22:39,505 --> 00:22:40,992
>> TOMAS REIMERS: No, not at all.

543
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:45,764
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: What matters is
the order within your CSS style sheet.

544
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,430
AUDIENCE: Could you repeat the question?

545
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,680
TOMAS REIMERS: Oh.

546
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,990
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Within
class, when you're giving classes

547
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,964
to something in the HTML, does
it matter which order they're in?

548
00:22:56,964 --> 00:22:58,130
It doesn't matter the order.

549
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,915
What matters is the order of the
class selectors within your CSS,

550
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,306
within your style sheet.

551
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:06,982
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Sound good?

552
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,532
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Lovely.

553
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:11,539
>> TOMAS REIMERS: And then
we're going to continue to--

554
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:13,330
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
What do we have next?

555
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,245
I forget.

556
00:23:14,245 --> 00:23:16,087
Oh, we just have examples.

557
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:17,295
But we've kind of done those.

558
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,990
We've done examples on the fly.

559
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,540
>> TOMAS REIMERS: We get to
combine the selectors soon.

560
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,790
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Oh,
we get to combine selectors.

561
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,260
TOMAS REIMERS: So some
examples is we have

562
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,630
#dog-- pound, or hashtag,
or octothorpe, or whatever

563
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,050
you want to call that-- sharp.

564
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,875
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Sharp dog.

565
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,470
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Then you have .pets.

566
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,059

567
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,600
Something has an id of dog,
there's only one dog on the page.

568
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,870
Something has an id of
cat, there's only one cat.

569
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,665
There may be many pets on the page.

570
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,570
That's why we gave that classes.

571
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,740
You have an example of p.

572
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,490
And then so one of the
last example, which

573
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,790
is something we haven't talked about,
is what happens when you combine them.

574
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,580
So p.pets.

575
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,510

576
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:02,950
>> So for that, let's go back to the
code and introduce another-- yeah.

577
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,290
So back here.

578
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:04,850
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I
feel like this is really--

579
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:08,105
like just looking through examples
is really the way to learn this.

580
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:09,360
So that's what we're doing.

581
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,030
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So let's pretend we
only want to select text 2, right?

582
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,530
So we definitely can't
do that with an id.

583
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,620
Well, we could do that with an
id, but it doesn't have an id.

584
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,490
I could add one, but let's pretend
that I didn't want to add one

585
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,910
or it already has something else.

586
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,516
I can't do that with that.

587
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,870
The tag is definitely not unique, right?

588
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,670
And neither is the class.

589
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,314
But you can combine these things.

590
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:35,230
Let's say we wanted to do something
which only applies to things which

591
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,420
have the class special and
which have the class pretty.

592
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:48,150
>> So what you can do is in main.css,
you can say, let's first delete this.

593
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,240
You can combine these.

594
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,430
So you can do .special.

595
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,110
No space.

596
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,770
Just .special.pretty.

597
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:00,550
What that means is something
which is both special and pretty.

598
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,900
Does that make sense?

599
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,190
And if we go here, what
you're going to see

600
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,734
is this rule only applies to the
second one, which has both of those.

601
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:11,400
And you can do that for a lot of things.

602
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,270
You can say-- let's
pretend I only wanted

603
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,300
to do things which have the class pretty
and which are also a paragraph tag.

604
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,920
So p.pretty.

605
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,585
Let's pretend that I had
something pretty on the tag body.

606
00:25:23,585 --> 00:25:25,850
OK?

607
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,490
I can run this and I
can see that it's only

608
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:32,720
going to apply to things which are
paragraphs with the class pretty.

609
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,650
And you can combine these,
basically, as many as you want.

610
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,580
So you can just put them together.

611
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,604
Does that make sense?

612
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,770
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: So
this kind of is more useful

613
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,490
when, Tomas was saying earlier, maybe
you have a very complicated website,

614
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,050
and you already have a lot
of these rules written,

615
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,170
and you just need to
combine two from before.

616
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:55,350
Like instead of writing a whole
new selector and changing it there,

617
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,592
you can just combine
them where it overlaps.

618
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:00,670
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Or you
might find out-- sometimes

619
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,290
there's one class which
makes font's color like blue,

620
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,740
and there's another class which
makes the background blue.

621
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,840
And that just won't work.

622
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,924
So you write a special case, where,
like-- but if it has both, what you're

623
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:13,548
going to do is you're going to
make this one this shade of blue

624
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:15,310
and this one this other shade of blue.

625
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,580
Right?

626
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,955
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Good
for those kinds of exceptions.

627
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:21,220
TOMAS REIMERS: So to
think about problems

628
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,000
that might arise when you combine them.

629
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,020
Cool.

630
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,692
So back to our presentation.

631
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:31,400
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
We're almost there.

632
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,022
TOMAS REIMERS: And it
has stopped connecting.

633
00:26:34,022 --> 00:26:36,494
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Oh, no.

634
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,125
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: CS at
the office, internet goes down.

635
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,360
Oh, the irony.

636
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,620
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So fortunately, we can
present without the internet, I guess,

637
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,380
because we have all the slides here.

638
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,304
So let's talk about the
relationship of tags.

639
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:50,470
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Right.

640
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,660
So just kind of going
off of what Tomas said,

641
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,180
this is just another way to do it.

642
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,840
So we have some parent
selector with a child selector.

643
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,815
So in this example here, we have some
body with a class navbar, class button.

644
00:27:02,815 --> 00:27:03,315
Ah.

645
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:03,990
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Oh, sorry.

646
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,180
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: And
basically, what this means

647
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,070
is select all of the children, like
all of these sorts of selectors,

648
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,040
within this parent selector.

649
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,004
And those are the only ones
it's ever going to apply to.

650
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:17,755
I don't know if you
have a better way of--

651
00:27:17,755 --> 00:27:19,504
TOMAS REIMERS: So I
guess the way to think

652
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,440
about this is remember before how
we sort of like put them together.

653
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,340
And then that means one element
which matches all of these.

654
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,530
What this is saying is, I
want you to match everything

655
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,220
within some-- I want
you to find a selector.

656
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,670
And then within that, I want
you to match new things.

657
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,170
Right?

658
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,900
So in CSS, it's all about sort of
being able to match these items.

659
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,050
And you can try to match
items within other items.

660
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,510
>> So let's actually do an example,
and we think that'll clarify.

661
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:53,090
So let's pretend we have special,
special pretty, whatever.

662
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,690
And then we have a link, OK?

663
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,780

664
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,370
So remember, a is a link.

665
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,900
It's not going to go anywhere.

666
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:11,500
And we're going to give it
the class link, I guess.

667
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,335
Let's give it the
class-- give me an idea.

668
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:14,460
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Cool.

669
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,420
TOMAS REIMERS: Coo-- let's
go it the class pretty.

670
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:16,930
Why not?

671
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,971
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: OK.

672
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:23,040
TOMAS REIMERS: So
right now pretty things

673
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,000
are going to make the background
blue, background color of salmon.

674
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,969
That makes sense.

675
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:28,760
And if we do this--

676
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,620
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Do you want to add text

677
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,078
so the hyperlink actually shows up?

678
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:35,088
TOMAS REIMERS: That
would be a good call.

679
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,921
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: 'Cause right
now we're just gonna get nothing.

680
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,690
TOMAS REIMERS: So this is a link.

681
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,202
"This is a link."

682
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:45,820
Oh, and this is going
to be another link.

683
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,280
Let's give it the class "cool."

684
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,295
You're right.

685
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:50,795
Cool.

686
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,590

687
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,010
So right now we're going to grab this.

688
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,269
We're going to throw one.

689
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,060
We have one in the
special tag, and we also

690
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,150
are going to have one in the pretty tag.

691
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,449
And right now what we're going to
do is we're going to make cool--

692
00:29:05,449 --> 00:29:06,490
what do we want it to do?

693
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,347

694
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:12,180
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Can we make it larger?

695
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,800
TOMAS REIMERS: Let's give it a border.

696
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,840
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: We could border.

697
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,673
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

698
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:18,560
So we're going to do something
like, border is-- and we're

699
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,971
going to explain this all in a second.

700
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:21,470
For now--

701
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,592
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: To the box model.

702
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:27,300
TOMAS REIMERS: But for now, we're
just going to give it a border.

703
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,580
So what that means is you're
going to see these links.

704
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,788
And you're going to see that they have
these, like, ugly black borders, which

705
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:33,820
is cool.

706
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,500
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Our website's so pretty.

707
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,333
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

708
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:38,930
Our website is awesome.

709
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,585
So these two are links, and they appear.

710
00:29:41,585 --> 00:29:44,160
Now let's pretend I
only wanted to do this

711
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,072
if it was not within something
which had a background of salmon.

712
00:29:50,072 --> 00:29:52,280
So remember that this one
has a background of salmon,

713
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,000
because it's of class pretty.

714
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,777
>> But we want to say that only cools
which are in class special, not in class

715
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:02,890
pretty, should have that border.

716
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:12,549
Well, what you can do is you
can say, .special, space, .cool.

717
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,590
And what that's doing, when you think
about it, is it's basically saying,

718
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,530
OK, find me everything
that matches special.

719
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:24,104
Then within those tags, find
me everything that's cool.

720
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:27,270
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: So another way
that might be good to think about this,

721
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,810
bringing it back to C, is
just like the idea of scope.

722
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,020
So when you have some
selector, like the ones

723
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,460
that we've been working for before this,
your entire web page, all of your HTML

724
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,180
is within your scope, right?

725
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,090
But when we have these
parent-child relationships,

726
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,130
it's as if you're narrowing down where
you're looking to a specific place,

727
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,540
as if, like, we're looking within
a specific function instead

728
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,007
of our entire file.

729
00:30:52,007 --> 00:30:55,090
AUDIENCE: So with that in mind, would
it have mattered if we had changed--

730
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,423
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: The order?

731
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:59,320
AUDIENCE: --the class in CSS
to .cool, space, .special?

732
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,153
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Yes, because then that

733
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:04,420
would say, scope it to
everything that has cool,

734
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,235
and then look at what has--
I mean, like, in this case,

735
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:08,860
I don't think it would have changed it.

736
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,318
>> TOMAS REIMERS: If we had said what?

737
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:10,906
Sorry.

738
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:12,660
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: If we
scope it to cool and then

739
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,550
look for things out of special,
it would be the same, actually.

740
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,260
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So it would not be.

741
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,590
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: It wouldn't?

742
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,590
Oh, oh well.

743
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,090
I am wrong.

744
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,480
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So the reason
it's different-- common mistake--

745
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,140
is that right now only
the link has cool, right?

746
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,176
I guess my question to you guys is,
what on this page is matched by .cool?

747
00:31:32,176 --> 00:31:35,984

748
00:31:35,984 --> 00:31:38,340
There are two tags here, right?

749
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,770
Which is this one and this one.

750
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,590
Both match cool.

751
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,200
Nothing else does.

752
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,460
So if you said, .cool, space,
.special, what you're going to say is,

753
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,824
within these tags, what is special?

754
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:49,865
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Hm.

755
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:51,800
That's what it-- right.

756
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,310
Because it's like just something here.

757
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,310
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So it selects nothing.

758
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,530
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Whereas with
special, we're within these tags here.

759
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,971
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Those and those.

760
00:31:57,971 --> 00:31:58,512
AUDIENCE: OK.

761
00:31:58,512 --> 00:31:58,920
So those tags from the forward slash?

762
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,740
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yes.

763
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,150
Does that make sense?

764
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,685
How it's basically
trying to narrow scope.

765
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:04,810
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah.

766
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,870
I think that's probably the
easiest way to think about it.

767
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,270
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So we found this, and
we found this both matched special.

768
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,400
And then we're asking, within
these guys, what's cool?

769
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,941
And within this one, this one's cool.

770
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:14,500
Within this one, nothing's cool.

771
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,250
So this is the only tag that remains.

772
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,112
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Whereas cool
is just within these a tags there.

773
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:21,070
TOMAS REIMERS: Exactly.

774
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,403
And what's special within those?

775
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:22,930
Nothing.

776
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,270
Now, what I will say is
if there was no space,

777
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,880
you're asking what's cool and special--
or what's pretty and special, right?

778
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,370
If you say .special.pretty, that's
the same as .pretty.special.

779
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,220
>> Because what removing the space is
asking is, when you say .special,

780
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,970
you're asking, OK,
which ones are special?

781
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,780
And then of those, which
ones are also pretty,

782
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,010
which is the same, grammatically,
as asking, what's pretty,

783
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,500
and then of those, what's also special?

784
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,000
Right?

785
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,099
It's the difference of
what's within what is.

786
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:53,640
AUDIENCE: OK.

787
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,473
TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

788
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,670

789
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,030
Awesome.

790
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,426
So with that in mind then--

791
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:01,800
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I think our last
thing is (IN FANCY BRITISH ACCENT)

792
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,510
the box model.

793
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,992
>> TOMAS REIMERS: The box-- [CHUCKLES]
I love the way Allison says that.

794
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:06,950
So the box model thing.

795
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,644
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Just have
a box, I'll be your box model.

796
00:33:09,644 --> 00:33:11,310
TOMAS REIMERS: So let's talk about that.

797
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,070
So right now we've spent a lot
of time talking about selectors.

798
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,944
By now, you guys are probably, like,
masters of selectors-- you know,

799
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:21,510
how to exactly select the content that
you want to manipulate on your screen.

800
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,740
>> So now the question is, how
exactly can you manipulate it?

801
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,010
So I guess the most basic
way to think about that

802
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,294
is, well, what exactly
is an element in CSS?

803
00:33:30,294 --> 00:33:32,585
We've spent a lot of time
talking about, what is a tag,

804
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:36,140
or what is the most basic
representation of a tag?

805
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,870

806
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:45,170
>> A good way to think about
that is, what shape is salmon?

807
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,295
What shape is, like, the
salmon-colored background?

808
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:47,880
>> AUDIENCE: It's a rectangle.

809
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,040
>> TOMAS REIMERS: It's a rectangle, right?

810
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,956
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Wasn't a trick question.

811
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:51,870
[LAUGHTER]

812
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,670
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Not trying
to trick you guys this late.

813
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,510
So we have this rectangle.

814
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,140
And the tag is a p, right?

815
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,280
So that gives us good
belief that the paragraph

816
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,440
is represented as a rectangle, at
least in the mind of the browser, which

817
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,715
it is.

818
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:11,423
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I mean,
browsers are typically rectangular,

819
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:13,440
so it makes sense.

820
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,750
>> TOMAS REIMERS: The idea here is
that all of the tags within CSS

821
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,790
are represented as a rectangle.

822
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,699
And every rectangle has four
parts according to CSS, OK?

823
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,830
You have the actual content.

824
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,644
That's where the text lies.

825
00:34:29,644 --> 00:34:30,470
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Maybe your picture.

826
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,303
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

827
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,860
You have padding, which is
just some kind of white space.

828
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,085
Then you have a border.

829
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,710
And then you have margin, which
is white space outside of that.

830
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,460
So that makes no sense
to anyone, so we're

831
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:42,500
going to talk about that for a second.

832
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,570
So right here, what we're going to do
is we're going to create some divs, OK?

833
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:48,420
Excuse me while I--

834
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,506
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I feel like
we should put a cute picture in.

835
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,520
>> TOMAS REIMERS: We definitely should.

836
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,389
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
I feel like everyone

837
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,870
could benefit from a
cute picture, is all.

838
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,774
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Can we
all benefit from a--

839
00:34:56,774 --> 00:34:57,648
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

840
00:34:57,648 --> 00:34:58,790
TOMAS REIMERS: OK, cool.

841
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,254
So we should put a cute
picture in somewhere.

842
00:35:02,254 --> 00:35:05,295
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I feel like a
cute bunny might be useful right now.

843
00:35:05,295 --> 00:35:06,190
TOMAS REIMERS: Sure.

844
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,950
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: End of the week.

845
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,390
Have something adorab--

846
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,520
>> TOMAS REIMERS: How bout a kitten?

847
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,220
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
A kitten works, too.

848
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,300
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Cool, because
there's a site for that.

849
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,300
It's called PlaceKitten.

850
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,719
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: That's great.

851
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,510
TOMAS REIMERS: Yes.

852
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,040
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Just for, like,
placeholder images in your website.

853
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,914
TOMAS REIMERS: Mm-hm.

854
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:21,520
There's also PlacePuppy.

855
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,832
And there's PlaceBacon.

856
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:24,340
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: PlaceBacon?

857
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,350
Really?

858
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,190
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Oh, we don't
have internet access here.

859
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,875
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: [GROANS]

860
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:30,375
Tragic.

861
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:32,333
TOMAS REIMERS: Otherwise,
I would show you guys

862
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,870
how to put images in your website.

863
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,370
We're going to try to get this
working before we have to go.

864
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,660
But for now, we're just
going to talk in colors then.

865
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,820
We want to put pictures of kittens--

866
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,210
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: We did.

867
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,110
>> TOMAS REIMERS: --the internet's
down for the moment being.

868
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,820
So we have two divs, and we're
going to give them two ids.

869
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,380

870
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,760
We're going to call it
"first" and "second."

871
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,184
So id= "first."

872
00:36:01,184 --> 00:36:02,850
And we're going to give them two colors.

873
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:08,424
So how do we select something
with an id of "first"?

874
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:09,840
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Dot or hash?

875
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,730
AUDIENCE: Sharp.

876
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,940
TOMAS REIMERS: Sharp, perfect.

877
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,950
Sharp, hash, whatever we--

878
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:15,680
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Lots of things to call it.

879
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,430
>> TOMAS REIMERS: OK.

880
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,800
We're going to settle on hashtag, and
that's what we're going to go with.

881
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,300
OK?

882
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:20,735
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Hashtag.

883
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:22,340
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So hashtag's first.

884
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,506
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: So
you can tweet the seminar--

885
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:27,582
hashtag CSS, hashtag cool.

886
00:36:27,582 --> 00:36:29,040
TOMAS REIMERS: Hashtag Awesomeness.

887
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,730
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
Hashtag Awesomeness, yes.

888
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,480
TOMAS REIMERS: OK.

889
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,660
So we have "first" and "second."

890
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,697
So first, we're going to have
a background color of red.

891
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:39,030
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Uh, colon.

892
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,281
TOMAS REIMERS: Yup.

893
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,281
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
I'll be your spot-checker.

894
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:43,960
TOMAS REIMERS: Allison's got me.

895
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,830
Background-color of blue--

896
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:46,810
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Purple!

897
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,726
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Purple.

898
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:48,830
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yes.

899
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,630
Purple's my favorite color,
and we haven't used it yet.

900
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,546
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Violet.

901
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:53,361
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Violet.

902
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:53,860
That works.

903
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,482

904
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:59,880
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So we're
going to have two divs.

905
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,654
They're going to be totally empty.

906
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,070
We should probably have some text.

907
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,580

908
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,815
So "first" is going to be "HELLO."

909
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:10,940
And the "second" will say--

910
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,110
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Goodbye.

911
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,514
>> AUDIENCE: --"WORLD."

912
00:37:12,514 --> 00:37:14,122
Hello, goodbye.

913
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:16,580
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I saw
them in concert the other week.

914
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,705
TOMAS REIMERS: The Beatles?

915
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:20,242
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: For reals.

916
00:37:20,242 --> 00:37:21,200
They're not that great.

917
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,084

918
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:24,750
I don't like it.

919
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,060
>> TOMAS REIMERS: We have
"HELLO" and "GOODBYE."

920
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,102
And again, CSS is just awesome,
because it recognizes our colors.

921
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:30,810
Don't need to even
worry that they exist.

922
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,194
They do.

923
00:37:33,194 --> 00:37:35,130
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: They exist.

924
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,560
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So CSS I think has
255 words to talk about color.

925
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,986
If you can think of a color outside
those 255, like, I will be impressed.

926
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:44,110
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Yeah.

927
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,560
I think you guys may have
just come in right after.

928
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,727
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So here,
you'll see we have two boxes

929
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:49,143
right on top of each other, right?

930
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,200
HELLO and GOODBYE.

931
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,460
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
There's no space in between.

932
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,390
They're just smooshed
right on top of each other.

933
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,973
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So the first thing
I guess we should talk about

934
00:37:55,973 --> 00:38:02,960
is let's also say-- yeah.

935
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,020
So CSS represents them as sort of boxes.

936
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,100
And as boxes, they have content.

937
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,540
And the content right now is sort of
the HELLO or the GOODBYE and that's it.

938
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,040
OK?

939
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,790
>> So one of the first things you
can do is you can add padding.

940
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:25,610
Padding says how much space
it should leave on each side.

941
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:29,200
So let's say I want to say
10 pixels on each side.

942
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,234
And I will dissect that in a second.

943
00:38:31,234 --> 00:38:33,150
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
All of these things here

944
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,980
are going to be mostly in pixels
for the rest of the seminar.

945
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,980
You're going to see that it has
some space around it, right?

946
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:46,360
So what you don't see here is there's
this invisible sort of padding

947
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,600
on each side, which says, like,
OK, you have your box of content--

948
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,680
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Do you want
to just pull up the inspect element?

949
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,659
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah, that's a good idea.

950
00:38:53,659 --> 00:38:56,700
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Also, I find
that the inspect element is a good way

951
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,280
to figure out if something's going
wrong, something unexpected happens,

952
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,570
inspecting the tags and seeing what
it's like overwritten is helpful.

953
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,940
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So I'm not sure
if you guys can see this color.

954
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,470
Can you?

955
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,120
You'll see this padding
on the sort of edge.

956
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,410
And then you see the actual
content in blue, right?

957
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,820
So that's the very
basics of the box model.

958
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,674
You have content.

959
00:39:17,674 --> 00:39:18,590
Then you have padding.

960
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,440
>> AUDIENCE: Why don't you just
use the box inside the--

961
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,606
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Right.

962
00:39:21,606 --> 00:39:24,745
Because it's just selecting
the element right now.

963
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,050
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yup.

964
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,060
Other things.

965
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,780
So let's talk about that
padding command for a second.

966
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:36,380
So in CSS, measurements
need to have a unit.

967
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,740
So first you have the amount.

968
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,460
So in this case, we've said 10.

969
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,780
And then the next one
we've said is pixels, px.

970
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,160
Other ones you might have are
things like centimeters, inches.

971
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,367
You can do things like,
what is 10 inches?

972
00:39:51,367 --> 00:39:52,700
And it's going to be ridiculous.

973
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:52,990
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Oh, boy.

974
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,460
>> AUDIENCE: Whoa.

975
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
>> TOMAS AND ALLISON: Yeah.

976
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,840
TOMAS REIMERS: So that's all padding.

977
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,255
I'm going to go back to pixels.

978
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:01,754
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Pixels
tend to be, like, the standard.

979
00:40:01,754 --> 00:40:04,589
When you look at a lot of websites,
they mostly work in pixels.

980
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:07,755
TOMAS REIMERS: So you're going to see
either pixels-- the other ones you see

981
00:40:07,755 --> 00:40:13,952
is em, which is one em is
equal to the height of the font

982
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:15,160
which you're currently using.

983
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,201
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Mm.

984
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:17,574

985
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:20,740
TOMAS REIMERS: It's a good way to say,
like, I want as much space as my font

986
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,514
is taking.

987
00:40:21,514 --> 00:40:23,180
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Did not know that.

988
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,747
You learn something new every day.

989
00:40:25,747 --> 00:40:27,955
TOMAS REIMERS: There are a
lot of measurements in CS.

990
00:40:27,955 --> 00:40:29,260
I suggest you look them up.

991
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,122
For all your cases, I think
pixels should be sufficient.

992
00:40:32,122 --> 00:40:33,830
And they're also what
you're going to see

993
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,520
in the majority of examples done online.

994
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,320
So we'll leave it at pixels.

995
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,420
>> You can also, I should say-- so
padding sets all of the paddings.

996
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:49,789
You can also do something like
"padding-top" to just set--

997
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:52,080
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Maybe
we'll get our "HELLO" back.

998
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,480
TOMAS REIMERS: --to just set the
padding on the top and nothing else.

999
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,560
So the four commands are padding-top,
padding-bottom, padding-left,

1000
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,310
and padding-right.

1001
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,470
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Just like
you would expect for a box.

1002
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,530
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

1003
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,240
Nothing too crazy there.

1004
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,230
Does that make sense?

1005
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,990
So that is padding.

1006
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:14,110
I'm going to set all
the paddings back to 10.

1007
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,010
And then I'm going to move on to border.

1008
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:21,130
>> So what border is is
border's a weird command.

1009
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:24,450
It takes sort of three things at once.

1010
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:28,930
So the first is how big you
want it to be as a measurement.

1011
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,662
Again, I'm only using pixels.

1012
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,620
And the last thing I
should add to measurements

1013
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,270
is the one thing which
doesn't need a unit is 0.

1014
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,390
It's actually incorrect
to give 0 a unit,

1015
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:41,940
because 0 is 0 across inches,
pixels, centimeters, whatever.

1016
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,960
It all just means 0, right?

1017
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,710
So first you give it the measurement.

1018
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,650
>> Then you give it the style.

1019
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,869
So I'm going to say "solid."

1020
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:51,410
And we'll talk about what that means.

1021
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,290
And then lastly, you give it a color.

1022
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,850
So I'm going to say "black."

1023
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:59,637
And these are all things we've
now seen before, except for style,

1024
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:00,720
but we'll talk about that.

1025
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,120
So you guys have seen measurements,
and you've seen colors.

1026
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,410
And what happens is we get this
nice black border around it, right?

1027
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,620
You guys see how we did that?

1028
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,760
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1029
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,850
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Cool.

1030
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,370
So what is that?

1031
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,160
So first of all, it's one pixel.

1032
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,880
That's self-evident enough, right?

1033
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,254
Like, it's one pixel thick.

1034
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:26,170
Or it would be one pixel, but I'm
zoomed in, so it's a little bit more

1035
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:26,490
than that.

1036
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:27,967
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: And we have
this ridiculous resolution TV.

1037
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,460
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

1038
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,640
You can make it bigger,
smaller, whatever.

1039
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,630
So here's a two-pixel border.

1040
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:38,810
You'll see it's twice as thick.

1041
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,172
Next thing you have is color.

1042
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:41,130
That's not interesting.

1043
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,710
I'm not going to talk
about that, really.

1044
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,110
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: But the style
might be just a little interesting.

1045
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,980
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

1046
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,560
So style, there are few ones
that I see used commonly.

1047
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,690
First one's solid, next one's
dotted, and the last one's dashed.

1048
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,290
And here is dotted.

1049
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:02,980
You'll see that they're
a bunch of dots, right?

1050
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:09,030
A good way to sort of get a nice border
going, dashes are also pretty popular.

1051
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,580

1052
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,600
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
And then of course, I'm

1053
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,660
sure there are plenty other
styles that you can get.

1054
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,000
And we have a great set of
links at the end for you guys

1055
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,470
to kind of peruse and
look at more cool CSS.

1056
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,954
>> TOMAS REIMERS: And then
the last thing, we're

1057
00:43:25,954 --> 00:43:27,870
going to talk about the
box models real quick.

1058
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,070
Oh, and then border,
exactly like padding,

1059
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,270
you also have things like
border-left, border-right, border-top,

1060
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,590
border-bottom, which allow you
to get at a specific border.

1061
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,650
So here's just the border left-defined.

1062
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,060
Does that makes sense?

1063
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,170
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: It's a cool
way to emphasize things or add

1064
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,545
lines between different elements.

1065
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:48,670
TOMAS REIMERS: Absolutely.

1066
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,940
So that's our border.

1067
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,790
And the last one's margin.

1068
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,892
Margin's like padding
except it's not within--

1069
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:57,975
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: It's
not around your element

1070
00:43:57,975 --> 00:44:00,840
but actually around the entire
box that we've been seeing.

1071
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,770
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

1072
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,090
Allison said it perfectly.

1073
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,550
It's not, like, inside your
element, it's around the whole box.

1074
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,900
That means things like
background don't apply to it.

1075
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,550
And it basically says,
like, I don't want anything

1076
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,230
in this much space for me.

1077
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:17,470
So like here we have
a margin of 10 pixels.

1078
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:23,100
So nothing within 10 pixels
should be next to me.

1079
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,210
That's kind of its
space but kind of not.

1080
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,215
So that's the very
basics of the box model.

1081
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:30,090
Does that make sense?

1082
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:33,830

1083
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,550
Cool, cool.

1084
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:35,800
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Awesome.

1085
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,890
So now I think we just
have our cool resources

1086
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,220
that we'll take you guys
through very quickly.

1087
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,815
And we'll actually-- well,
do we have internet yet?

1088
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,860
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Let's
see if I can open up--

1089
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:50,040
let me just see if I
can get internet quickly

1090
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,317
while Allison talks about anything
Allison wants to talk about.

1091
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:55,150
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
So basically-- I don't

1092
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,930
know what else I can say at this point.

1093
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:01,340
But these are some
really good resources.

1094
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,629
These are ones that
Tomas and I have used

1095
00:45:04,629 --> 00:45:06,420
and that we actually
used to prep for this.

1096
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,940
W3Schools is one that you
guys should have seen before.

1097
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,440
We recommend it for a
lot of things with CSS.

1098
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,060
I know I recommend it to
my section all the time.

1099
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:21,050
>> One of the great things is that it
allows you to kind of mess with CSS

1100
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,830
and see the changes
instantaneously in this,

1101
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,920
like, double-window view that it has.

1102
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,980
So you don't have to worry about
setting up your own web page,

1103
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,090
or setting up vhost in your
local appliance and local host,

1104
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,980
and getting all that stuff working.

1105
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,830
It is embedded right within the page.

1106
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,042
>> And it has these little
lessons that you can

1107
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,750
go through to learn
more about selectors,

1108
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,610
or learn about manipulating your
font, or a background, or an image.

1109
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,990
And you have these
instantaneous results that you

1110
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,310
don't have to do any
other prep work for.

1111
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,060
So I love W3Schools.

1112
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,960
It's fabulous.

1113
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,670
Is it working?

1114
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:52,950
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah.

1115
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,720
No, it's not.

1116
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,636
Do you want me to try
and restart my computer?

1117
00:45:55,636 --> 00:45:56,410
Or do we want to--

1118
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:01,490
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: I mean,
well, this will also be online.

1119
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,740
All the slides will be online.

1120
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,470
So I just highly recommend doing these.

1121
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,880
>> This is great as just
like a cheat sheet.

1122
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,690
It's just all the basic
commands that you have.

1123
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,070
It's great when you're first
starting out your website.

1124
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,080
Because maybe you don't
want to get into all

1125
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,355
the real nitty gritty
design-heavy stuff.

1126
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:20,230
You just need to format it in a way
that kind of makes sense and will

1127
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,490
do for the time being.

1128
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,580
And if you really want
to get into it, I know

1129
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,240
this is, like, one of
Tomas's favorite references.

1130
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,130
We were using it to
prep, and it's fabulous.

1131
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,030
It's the Developer from Mozilla.

1132
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,490
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So Mozilla are
the people who make Firefox.

1133
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:40,290
And it's just their own developer
reference, which I think is awesome.

1134
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:44,870
And it has a wonderful
list of resources.

1135
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:45,530
So we have--

1136
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,060
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
And then last note is

1137
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,120
when you're trying to
design your website,

1138
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,550
draw inspiration from things
that you think are pretty.

1139
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,340
Inspecting the element,
inspecting the source code

1140
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,370
can be super helpful
for trying to figure out

1141
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,080
how to style your own website.

1142
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,540
>> Often, I feel like the best
way, besides experimentation,

1143
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,290
is just to look at
things that are pretty.

1144
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:09,810
I find it's really hard to just
kind of design things on your own,

1145
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,090
especially in the beginning.

1146
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:14,740
So please look at websites
that you enjoy looking at.

1147
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,880
Figure out what makes
them appealing to you.

1148
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,170
And then feel free to
try and replicate that.

1149
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,410
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Right.

1150
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,120
Even like websites
like this, you can see

1151
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,460
there's definitely a div at the top.

1152
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,920
And then you have another div within
here, which is CSS Awesomeness.

1153
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,480
And then you have a bunch of links here.

1154
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,770
If you really just inspect
elements, you can sort of

1155
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:38,520
start to see what do websites
look like, and how can I

1156
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,493
recreate that if I wanted to.

1157
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:41,890
Does that make sense?

1158
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,670
So we only have three minutes left.

1159
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,380
So questions?

1160
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,650
Any of them?

1161
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,350
Yes.

1162
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,780
>> AUDIENCE: For the color
rectangle, how would you

1163
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,499
have-- if you didn't want it
going across the whole page, could

1164
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:56,400
you have made it go across only
half the page or just the text?

1165
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,660
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Yeah, absolutely.

1166
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:02,780
So let me see actually.

1167
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,670
I have two ideas.

1168
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:07,265
So first of all, you
can also use percents.

1169
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:08,140
>> AUDIENCE: Really?

1170
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,260
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: So something
to look up is relative positioning.

1171
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,385
It's something that we
don't have time to get into,

1172
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:16,392
but it's something I definitely
recommend you guys checking out.

1173
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:17,580
>> TOMAS REIMERS: So percents.

1174
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,524
And see how we made it
just 50% of the width?

1175
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,190
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: If you
actually know the number of pixels,

1176
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,780
you can be more precise that way.

1177
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,200
You can fiddle around with it.

1178
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,700
But 50%.

1179
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,970
If we were to resize our browser,
it would make it smaller.

1180
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:35,250
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Well, it's
basically 50% right now, I think.

1181
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,820
It's 50%, and then the margin
has been added to that.

1182
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,100
CSS has a lot of quirks.

1183
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,195
So right now this is
50% of the page width.

1184
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:46,860
But remember that you have 10
pixels taken off from each side.

1185
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,700
So if you were to move that against
the left edge of the browser,

1186
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,550
then it would look like 50%.

1187
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,884
Again, like I said, CSS can
be a lot of guess-and-check.

1188
00:48:53,884 --> 00:48:56,049
Like, you think something's
going to behave one way,

1189
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:57,805
but it behaves a totally different way.

1190
00:48:57,805 --> 00:48:59,420
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
And you just get smarter,

1191
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,020
and you just get a better
intuition for it as you move along.

1192
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,730
>> TOMAS REIMERS: And it
gets worse and worse.

1193
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:03,496
So it's really just a race.

1194
00:49:03,496 --> 00:49:05,454
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU:
That's super encouraging.

1195
00:49:05,454 --> 00:49:07,070
We want them to like CSS.

1196
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,810
>> TOMAS REIMERS: CSS is awesome.

1197
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,354
Remember that.

1198
00:49:10,354 --> 00:49:11,020
Other questions?

1199
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,297
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: The one thing.

1200
00:49:14,297 --> 00:49:14,880
Anything else?

1201
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,140
Cool.

1202
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:15,690
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Awesome.

1203
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,523
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Well, if you
guys have any questions later on,

1204
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,919
we're always available as per usual.

1205
00:49:20,919 --> 00:49:22,960
You'll probably see some
of us for final projects

1206
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,280
and definitely at the hackathon.

1207
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,200
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Absolutely.

1208
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:25,720
And at the fair.

1209
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,560
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: And at the fair.

1210
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:26,840
Oh.

1211
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,130
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Look forward to
seeing all of your awesome--

1212
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,420
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: We'll see
all of your awesome websites

1213
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,572
that will be beautiful.

1214
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:32,780
TOMAS REIMERS: You can always
see, like, the websites

1215
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:36,234
who had, like, good CSS and then
like those who did not try to do CSS.

1216
00:49:36,234 --> 00:49:39,150
ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Also, another
thing, one more thing to look into

1217
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,445
is Bootstrapping.

1218
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:41,805
So Bootstrap is great.

1219
00:49:41,805 --> 00:49:42,240
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Google that if you--

1220
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,573
>> ALLISON BUCHHOLTZ-AU: Google it.

1221
00:49:43,573 --> 00:49:44,340
It's fabulous.

1222
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,620
You'll love it.

1223
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,000
And now that you have a
basic understanding of CSS,

1224
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,340
it'll make a lot more sense.

1225
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:50,890
Awesome.

1226
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:51,480
Thanks, guys.

1227
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,330
>> TOMAS REIMERS: Thank you so much.

1228
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:54,219
