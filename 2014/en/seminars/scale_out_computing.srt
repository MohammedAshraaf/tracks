1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,080

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,799
>> JAMES CUFF: Hi, good
afternoon, everyone.

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:14,715
My name is James Cuff.

4
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm the Assistant Dean for Research
Computing here at Harvard University.

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,540
And today I'm going to talk to you about
why scale-out computing is essential.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,810
>> So I guess, first up, who is this guy?

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,750
Why am I here?

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,200
Why am I talking to you?

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,730
I have a background in scientific
computing and research computing,

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,530
stretching back to the United
Kingdom-- The Wellcome Trust Sanger

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:43,270
Institute for the human genome-- and
then more recently in the United States

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:50,170
working at the Broad and other esteemed
places of learning, such as Harvard.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,930
>> I guess what that really means is
that I'm a recovering molecular bio

14
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,740
physicist.

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,250
So what right have I got to tell
you about scale-out computing?

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,570
There's a however.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:09,530
18 years or so I've just seen the most
dramatic increases in scale complexity

18
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,570
and overall efficiency
of computing systems.

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,890
>> When I was doing my PhD at Oxford, I
was pretty excited with a 200 megahertz

20
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,830
Silicon Graphics machine with 18
gigabytes of storage and a single CPU.

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,910
Times have changed.

22
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,860
If you fast forward now, we're spinning
over 60,000 CPUs here at Harvard.

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,810
Many other organizations
are spinning many more.

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,740
>> The important takeaway from this is
that scale is now not only inevitable,

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,910
it's happened and it's
going to continue to happen.

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,760
So let's, for a moment, kind
of rewind and talk very quickly

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,530
about science, my favorite
subject, the scientific method.

28
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,180
>> If you are to be a scientist,
you have to do a few key things.

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,140
If you don't do these things you can
not consider yourself a scientist

30
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:03,250
and you will struggle being able to
understand your area of discipline.

31
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,290
>> So first of all, you would formulate
your question, you generate hypotheses,

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,289
but more importantly, you
predict your results--

33
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:13,090
you have a guess as to
what the results will be.

34
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,560
And then finally, you test your
hypothesis and analyze your results.

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,460
>> So this scientific method is
extremely important in computing.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,450
Computing of both the prediction
and being able to test your results

37
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,660
are a key part of what we need
to do in the scientific method.

38
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,310
These predictions and testings
are the real two cornerstones

39
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,350
of the scientific method, and each
require the most significant advances

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,240
in modern computation.

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,210
>> The two pillars of science are that
of theory and that of experimentation.

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,300
And more recently,
computing is often mentioned

43
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,090
as being the third pillar of science.

44
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,440
So if you students are watching this,
you have absolutely no pressure.

45
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,960

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,720
Third pillar of science-- no big
deal-- computing, kind of important.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,000
So glad this is the computing part
of computer science course 50.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,220
>> So enough of the background.

49
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,226
I want to tell you the plan of what
we're going to talk about today.

50
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:22,870
I'm going to go over some history.

51
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,250
I'm going to explain why we got here.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,750
I'm going to talk about some
of the history of the computing

53
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,890
here at Harvard, some
activities around social media,

54
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,200
green things-- very
passionate about all things

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,640
green-- storage-- computer storage--
how chaos affects scale-out out systems,

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
and distributive systems in particular.

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,473
>> And then I'm going to touch on some
of the scale-out hardware that's

58
00:03:48,473 --> 00:03:51,370
required to be able to
do computing at scale.

59
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,830
And then finally, we're going to
wrap up with some awesome science.

60
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,894
>> So, let's take a minute to
look at our actual history.

61
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:01,810
Computing has evolved.

62
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:07,370
So since the '60s, all
the away through to today,

63
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,260
we've seen basically a change of
scope from centralized computing

64
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,679
to decentralize computing, to
collaborative and then independent

65
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,970
computing and right back again.

66
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,709
>> And let me annotate that a little bit.

67
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,370
When we first started off with
computers, we had mainframes.

68
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,824
They were inordinately
expensive devices.

69
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:23,990
Everything had to be shared.

70
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,556
The computing was complex.

71
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:29,060
You can see, it filled rooms and
there were operators and tapes

72
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,780
and all sorts of whirry,
clicky, spinny devices.

73
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,930
>> Around the '70s early '80s, you started
to see an impact of the fax machines.

74
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,620
So you're starting to see computing
start to appear back in laboratories

75
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,880
and become closer to you.

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,800
The rise of the personal
computer, certainly

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,460
in the '80s, early part of the
decade, really changed computing.

78
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,570
>> And there's a clue in
the title, because it

79
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:04,080
was called the personal computer,
which meant it belonged to you.

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,630
So as the evolution of
computing continued,

81
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,530
people realized that their personal
computer wasn't really big enough

82
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,020
to be able to do anything of any merit,
or significant merit, in science.

83
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,790
>> And so folks started to
develop network device

84
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,920
drivers to be able to connect PCs
together to be able to build clusters.

85
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,430
And so this begat the era
of the Beowulf cluster.

86
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:32,470
Linux exploded as a response to
proprietary operating system, both cost

87
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,650
and complexity.

88
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,530
>> And then, here we are today,
where, yet again, we're

89
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,610
faced with rooms full of computer
equipment and the ability

90
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,570
to swipe one's credit card and get
access to these computing facilities,

91
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,290
remotely.

92
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,680
>> And so you can then see, in
terms of history impacting

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,180
how we do computing
today, it's definitely

94
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,090
evolved from machine
rooms full of computers

95
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,160
through some personal computing
all the way right back again

96
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,400
to machine rooms full of computers.

97
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,620
>> So this is my first cluster.

98
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,170
So 2000, we built a
computer system in Europe

99
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,900
to effectively annotate
the human genome.

100
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,521
There's a lot of technology
listed on the right hand side

101
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,520
there that, unfortunately,
is no longer with us.

102
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,460
It's passed off to the
great technology in the sky.

103
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,610
>> The machine itself is probably
equivalent of a few decent laptops

104
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,020
today, and that just kind of shows you.

105
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:36,260
However, we did carefully annotate
the human genome and both protected it

106
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:43,190
with this particular paper in
Nature from the concerns the data

107
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,380
being public or private.

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:48,610
>> So this is awesome, right?

109
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,280
So we've got a human genome.

110
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,510
We've done computing.

111
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,400
I'm feeling very pleased myself.

112
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,090
I rolled up to Harvard in 2006,
feeling a lot less pleased with myself.

113
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,210
>> This is what I inherited.

114
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,575
This is a departmental
mail and file server.

115
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,450
You can see here there's
a little bit of tape

116
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,710
that's used to hold the system together.

117
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,890
This is our license and print server.

118
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,990
I'm pretty sure there maybe passwords
on some of these Post-it Notes.

119
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,560

120
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,360
>> Not awesome.

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,530
Pretty far from awesome.

122
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,060
And so, I realize this little chart
that I showed you at the beginning

123
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,350
from sharing to ownership
back to sharing,

124
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,930
that we needed to change the game.

125
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,330
And so we changed the game
by providing incentives.

126
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,250
And so human beings, as this
little Wikipedia article

127
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,990
says here, our purposeful creatures.

128
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,250
And the study of incentive
structures is essential to the study

129
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,100
of economic activity.

130
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,580
>> So we started to incentivize
our faculty and our researchers.

131
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,720
And so we incentivized them with
a really big computer system.

132
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,720
So in 2008, we built a 4,096
processor machine-- 10 racks,

133
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,470
couple hundred kilowatts of power.

134
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,178
>> What I think is
interesting is it doesn't

135
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:58,300
matter where you are in the cycle.

136
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,510
This same amount of power and
compute, the power is the constant.

137
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,270
It was 200 kilowatts when we
were building systems in Europe.

138
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,770
It's two hundred kilowatts
in 2008, and that

139
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,820
seems to be the [? quanter ?] of small
university-based computing systems.

140
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,540
>> So Harvard today-- fast forward, I'm no
longer sad panda, quite a happy panda.

141
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,860
We have 60-odd thousand load balanced
CPUs, and their climbing dramatically.

142
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,780
We have 15 petabytes of
storage, also climbing.

143
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,720
Again, this 200 kilowatt
increment, we seem

144
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,000
to be adding that
every six or so months.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,480
Lots and lots of virtual machines.

146
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,620
And more importantly,
about 1.8 megawatts

147
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,669
of research computing equipment.

148
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,820
>> And I'm going to come
back to this later on,

149
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,913
as to why I now no longer necessarily
count how much CPU we have,

150
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:48,980
but how big is the electricity bill.

151
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,690
20 other so dedicated
research computing staff.

152
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,250
And more importantly, we're
starting to grow our GPGPUs.

153
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:05,030
I was staggered at how much of this
is being added on a day-to-day basis.

154
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,310
So, history lesson over, right?

155
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,280
>> So how do we get there from here?

156
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,560
Let's look at some modern
scale-out compute examples.

157
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,290

158
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,230
I'm a little bit obsessed with the
size and scale of social media.

159
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,850
There are a number of extremely
successful large scale computing

160
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,820
organizations now on the planet,
providing support and services

161
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,810
to us all.

162
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,340
So that's the disclaimer.

163
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,990
>> And I want to start with a
number of ounces in an Instagram.

164
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,336
It's not actually a
lead-in to a joke, it's

165
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,460
not even that funny,
actually, come to think of it.

166
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,751
But anyway, we're going to
look at ounces in Instagram.

167
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:55,260
And we're going to start
with "My bee and a flower."

168
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,600
I was at [INAUDIBLE] Village
and I took a little picture

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,460
of a bee sitting on a flower.

170
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,270
And then I started to think about
what does this actually mean.

171
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,013
And I took this picture off my phone
and counted how many bytes are in it,

172
00:10:07,013 --> 00:10:09,070
and it's about 256 kilobytes.

173
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,550
Which when I started, would basically
fill a 5 and 1/4 inch floppy.

174
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,340
And started to think, well, that's cool.

175
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,630
>> And I started to look and do
some research on the network.

176
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,490
And I found out that Instagram
has 200 million MAUs.

177
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,105
I wasn't actually that
sure what a MAU was.

178
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:28,960
And a MAU, down here, is
a monthly active user.

179
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,270
>> So, 200 million MAUs-- pretty cool.

180
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,190
20 billion photographs-- so
quite a lot of photographs.

181
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,300
60 million new photographs
each and every day

182
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,990
coming out at about .002 gig per photo.

183
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,290
That's about five petabytes
of disk just right there.

184
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:55,480
And that's really not the central part
of what we're going to talk about.

185
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,830
That is small potatoes.

186
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,710
Or as we say in England, tiny spuds.

187
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,050
>> So let's look at the real elephant
in the room-- unique faces.

188
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,170
Again, let's measure in
this new quanta call a MAU.

189
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,260
Facebook itself has 1.3 billion MAUs.

190
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,510
WhatsApp, which I hadn't even
heard of until recently, it's

191
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:23,260
some sort messaging service,
is 500 million MAUs.

192
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,620
Instagram, which we just
talked about, 200 million MAUs.

193
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,370
And Messenger, which is
another messaging service,

194
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,120
is also 200 million MAUs.

195
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,920
>> So total that up, it's about
2.2 billion total users.

196
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,880
Clearly there's some overlap, but that's
equivalent to a third of the planet.

197
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,270
And they send something in the
region of 12 billion messages a day.

198
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,680
And again, there's only 7
billion people on the planet.

199
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,550
Not everyone has a smartphone.

200
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:53,960
So this is insane numbers.

201
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:02,050
>> And I'm going to argue that it's not
even about the storage or the compute.

202
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,610
And to quote the song,
it's all about that graph.

203
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,045
Here's our lovely Meghan Trainor down
here, singing about all the bass.

204
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:12,570
Note, she also has quite a
bit of bass herself-- 207,

205
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,460
well 218 million people have seen
this young lady singing her song.

206
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,910
>> So my argument is it
it's all about the graph.

207
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,480
So we took some open source software
and started to look at a graph.

208
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,740
And this is LinkedIn, so this
is a Facebook for old people.

209
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,910
And so, this is my LinkedIn graph.

210
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,080
I have 1,200 or so nodes,
so-called "Friends."

211
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,360
And here's me at the top.

212
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,140
And here's all of the interconnections.

213
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,570
>> Now, think back to the Instagram story.

214
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,815
Each one of these is
not just the photo, it

215
00:12:42,815 --> 00:12:46,860
has a whole plethora of connections
between this particular individual

216
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,220
and many others.

217
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,190
This is central piece is either a
bug in the graph drawing algorithm,

218
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:55,982
or this maybe David
Malan, I'm not sure yet.

219
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:57,690
So you can redraw the
graphs in all sorts

220
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,510
of ways-- gephi.gihub.io is where
you can pull that software from.

221
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,410
It's really cool for being
able to organize communities.

222
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,640
You can see here, this is Harvard and
various other places that I've worked,

223
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,160
because this is my work-related data.

224
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,080
>> So just think about the complexity
of the graph and all of the data

225
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,070
that you pull along with.

226
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,870
So meanwhile, back at FriendFace, right?

227
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,360
We looked at the Instagram data that
was of the order of five petabytes.

228
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,300
No big deal.

229
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,830
Still quite a lot of data, but no big
deal in the greater scheme of things.

230
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,850
>> From this article on the old internet,
"Scaling the Facebook data warehouse

231
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,250
to 300 petabytes."

232
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,110
That's a whole different
game changer now,

233
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,234
when you're starting to
think of data and the graph

234
00:13:40,234 --> 00:13:41,690
and what you bring along with.

235
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:47,480
And their high data is growing of
the order of 600 terrabytes a day.

236
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,980
>> Now, you know, well, then--
I mean, 600 terrabytes a day,

237
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,670
300 petabytes-- they're
also now starting

238
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,550
to get very concerned about
how to keep this stuff

239
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,160
and to make sure this data stays around.

240
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,630
And this gentleman here,
Jay Parikh, is looking

241
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,250
at how to store an exabyte of data.

242
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,180
>> Just for those of you
who are watching along

243
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,940
at home, an exabyte-- 10 to the 18.

244
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,210
It's got its own Wikipedia
page, it's that big of a number.

245
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,120
That is the size and scale of what we're
looking at, to be able to store data.

246
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,090
And these guys aren't mucking around,
they're storing that amount of data.

247
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,550
So one of the clues that
they're looking at here

248
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,185
is data centers for
so-called cold storage.

249
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:35,020

250
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,470
>> Which brings me to being green.

251
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,340
And here is Kermit.

252
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,050
He and I agree-- it's extremely
difficult to be green,

253
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,920
but we give it our best try.

254
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,430
Kermit can't help it, he has
to be green all the time,

255
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,945
can't take his green-ness off at all.

256
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:55,410
>> So, being concepts-- a
few kind of core concepts

257
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:59,510
of greenness, when it
relates to computing.

258
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:05,510
The one that is the most important
is the longevity of the product.

259
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,405
If your product has a short lifetime,
you cannot, by definition, be green.

260
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:13,280
The energy taken to manufacture a
disk drive, a motherboard, a computer

261
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,890
system, a tablet, whatever it may
be, the longevity of your systems

262
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:21,700
are a key part of how green you can be.

263
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,960
>> The important part, as all of you
are building software algorithms--

264
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,455
algorithm's a partial
word for software, right?

265
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:34,000
So, your algorithm design is
absolutely critical in terms

266
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,080
of how you are going to be able to make
quick and accurate computations to use

267
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,710
the least amount of energy possible.

268
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,280
And I'll get to this in a little bit.

269
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,270
>> Data center design-- you've seen
that we already have thousands

270
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,870
upon thousands of machines, sitting
quietly in small, dark corners

271
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,760
of the world, computing.

272
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,670
Resource allocation-- how to get
to the compute, to the storage,

273
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,840
through the network.

274
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,530
Operating systems are a key part of
this, and a lot of virtualization

275
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,080
to be able to pack more and
more compute into a small space.

276
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,530
>> I'll give you a small example
from research computing.

277
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,220
We needed more ping, more
power, and more pipe.

278
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,030
We needed more bigger,
better, faster computers,

279
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,390
and needed to use less juice.

280
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,856
And we couldn't work out how to do this.

281
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:29,980
I don't know if the hashtag gowest as
probably been used by the Kardashian,

282
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,560
but anyway, gowest.

283
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,220
And we did.

284
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,610
>> We picked up our operation
and we moved it out

285
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,660
to Western Massachusetts
in a small mill town

286
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,000
called Holyoke, just north
of Chikopee and Springfield.

287
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,280
We did this for a couple of reasons.

288
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,150
The main one was that we
had a very, very large dam.

289
00:16:55,150 --> 00:17:00,080
And this very large dam is able to
put out 30 plus megawatts of energy,

290
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,980
and it was underutilized at the time.

291
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,170
>> More importantly, we also had
a very complicated network

292
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,254
that was already in place.

293
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:09,711
If you look at where the network
goes in the United States,

294
00:17:09,711 --> 00:17:11,230
it follows all the train tracks.

295
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,290
This particular piece of network was
owned by our colleagues and friends

296
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,480
at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,

297
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,720
and it was basically built
all the way out to Route 90.

298
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,760
>> So we had a large river tick, Route 90
tick, we had a short path of 100 miles,

299
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,960
and a long path of about 1,000 miles.

300
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,890
We did have to do a very large
network splice, as you can see here,

301
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,990
to basically put a link in, to
be able to connect to Holyoke,

302
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,390
but we had all of the requisite
infrastructure-- ping, power, pipe.

303
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,280
Life was good.

304
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,980
And again, big dam.

305
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,120
>> So we built basically the Massachusetts
Green High Performance Computing

306
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,850
Center.

307
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,580
This was a labor of love through five
universities-- MIT, Harvard, UMass,

308
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,870
Northeastern, and BU.

309
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,554
Five megawatt day one connected load.

310
00:17:49,554 --> 00:17:51,845
We did all sorts of cleverness
with airside economizers

311
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:53,585
to keep things green.

312
00:17:53,585 --> 00:18:03,330
And we built out 640-odd racks,
dedicated for research computing.

313
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:08,770
>> It was an old brownfield site, so we
had some reclamation and some tidy-up

314
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,500
and some clean-up of the site.

315
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,590
And then we started
to build the facility

316
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:19,710
and, boom-- lovely facility with the
ability to run sandbox computing,

317
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,430
to have conferences and seminars,
and also a massive data center floor.

318
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,007
>> Here is my good self.

319
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:27,590
I'm obviously wearing the same jacket.

320
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,423
I maybe only have one
jacket, but there's me

321
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:34,030
and John Goodhue-- he's the
executive director of the Center--

322
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,740
standing in the machine room
floor, which, as you can see,

323
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,560
is pretty dramatic, and it
goes back a long, long way.

324
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,830
>> I often play games driving
from Boston out to Holyoke,

325
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,260
pretending that I'm a TCP/IP packet.

326
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:54,290
And I do worry about my latency
driving around in my car.

327
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,690
So that's the green piece.

328
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,070
So let's just take a minute
and think about stacks.

329
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,060
So we're trying very carefully to
build data centers efficiently,

330
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:08,770
computing efficiently, make good
selection for the computing equipment

331
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,060
and deliver, more
importantly, our application,

332
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,860
be it a messaging service
or a scientific application.

333
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,110
>> So here are the stacks.

334
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,762
So physical layer, all the
way up through application--

335
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,220
hoping that this is going to
be a good part of your course.

336
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,450
OSI seven layer model is basically,
you will live, eat, and breathe

337
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,270
this throughout your computing careers.

338
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,800
This whole concept of physical
infrastructure-- wires,

339
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,080
cables, data centers, links.

340
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,190
And this is just describing the network.

341
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,780
>> Up here is, well, obviously,
this is an old slide,

342
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,342
because this should say HTTP, because
nobody cares about simple mail

343
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:50,550
transport protocols, anymore.

344
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,960
It's all happening in the HTTP space.

345
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,850
So that's one level of stack.

346
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,460
>> Here's another set of stacks, where you
have a server, a host, a hypervisor,

347
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,470
a guest, binary library,
and then your application.

348
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,070
Or, in this case, the device
driver, a Linux kernel, native c,

349
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,080
Java virtual machine,
Java API, then Java

350
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,220
applications, and so on and so forth.

351
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,090
This is a description
of a virtual machine.

352
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,450
>> Holy stacks, Batman!

353
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,260
Think about this in
terms of how much compute

354
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,850
you need to get from
what's happening here,

355
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:23,110
all the way up to the top
of this stack, to then

356
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,840
be able to do your actual
delivery of the application.

357
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,130
>> And if you kind of
rewind and start to think

358
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,450
about what it takes to provide
a floating point operation,

359
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,650
your floating point operation is a sum
of the sockets, the number of cores

360
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:44,490
in the socket, a clock, which is
how fast can the clock turnover--

361
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,490
four gigahertz, two
gigahertz-- and then the number

362
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:50,890
of operations you can
do in a given hertz.

363
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,350
>> So those microprocessors today
do between four and 6 FLOPs

364
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,400
per clock cycle.

365
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,810
And so a single-core 2.5 gig clock
has a theoretical performance

366
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,490
of about a mega FLOP, give or take.

367
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,940
>> But, as with everything,
we have choices.

368
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,280
So and Intel Core 2, Nehalem
Sandy Bridge, Haswell, AMD,

369
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,920
take your choices-- Intel Atom .

370
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,670
All of these processor architectures
all have a slightly different way

371
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,650
of being able to add
two numbers together,

372
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,520
which is basically
their purpose in life.

373
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,535
Must be tough.

374
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,100
There's millions of them sitting
in data centers, now though.

375
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,410
>> Sor, flops per watt--
this is the big thing.

376
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:37,780
So if I want to get more of this
to get through this stack, faster,

377
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,800
I've got to work on how many
floating point operations a second,

378
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,770
I can do, and then give them watt.

379
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,160
And fortunately, folks
have thought about this.

380
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,140
>> So there's a large
contest every year to see

381
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,310
who can build the fastest computer
that can diagonalize a matrix.

382
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,980
It's called the Top 500.

383
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,420
They pick the top from
the best 500 computers

384
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,610
on the planet that can
diagonalize matrices.

385
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,760
And you get some amazing results.

386
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,660
>> A lot of those machines are
between 10 and 20 megawatts.

387
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,380
They can diagonalize matrices
inordinately quickly.

388
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,550
They don't necessarily diagonalized
them as efficiently per watt,

389
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,060
so there was this big push to look at
what a green 500 list would look like.

390
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,360
And here is the list from June.

391
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,410
There should be a new one very shortly.

392
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,590
>> And it calls out-- I'll take
the top of this particular list.

393
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,187
There's two specific machines-- one
from the Tokyo Institute of Technology

394
00:22:32,187 --> 00:22:34,520
and one from Cambridge
University in the United Kingdom.

395
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,700
And these have pretty staggering
mega flops per watt ratios.

396
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,620
This one's 4,389, and the
next one down is 3,631.

397
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,660
>> I'll explain the difference between
these two, in the next slide.

398
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,320
But these are these are
moderately sized test clusters.

399
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,732
These are just 34
kilowatts or 52 kilowatts.

400
00:22:54,732 --> 00:22:56,940
There are some larger ones
here-- this particular one

401
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,860
at the Swiss National
Supercomputing Centre.

402
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,693
The take home message
for this is that we're

403
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:04,270
trying to find computers
that can operate efficiently.

404
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:09,860
>> And so, let's look at this top
one, cutely called, the KFC.

405
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:12,960
And a little bit of advertising here.

406
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,730
This particular food company
has nothing to do with this.

407
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,240
It's the fact that
this particular system

408
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,830
is soaked in a very
clever oil-based compound.

409
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:27,590
And so they got their
chicken fryer moniker

410
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,040
when they first started to
build these types of systems.

411
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,740
>> But basically what they've taken
here is a number of blades,

412
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,560
put them in this
sophisticated mineral oil,

413
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,979
and then worked out how to get all
the networking in and out of it.

414
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:42,895
Then, not only that,
they've put it outside so

415
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:46,095
that it can exploit outside air cooling.

416
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:47,520
It was pretty impressive.

417
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,630
So you have to do all
of this shenanigans

418
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,280
to be able to get this amount of
compute delivered for small wattage.

419
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,360
>> And you can see this is the shape
of where things are heading.

420
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,240
The challenge is that regular air
cooling is the economy of scale

421
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,459
and is driving a lot of the
development of both regular computing,

422
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:09,750
and high performance computing.

423
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,080
So, this is pretty disruptive.

424
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,280
I think this is fascinating.

425
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,530
It's a bit messy when you
try to swap the disk drives,

426
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,090
but it's a really cool idea.

427
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,200
>> So not only that, there's
a whole bunch of work

428
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,450
being built around what we're
calling the Open Compute Project.

429
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,400
And so, more about that
a little bit later.

430
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,740
But the industry's starting to
realize that the FLOPs per watt

431
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,670
is becoming important.

432
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:39,256
And you, as folks here, as
you design your algorithms

433
00:24:39,256 --> 00:24:41,130
and you design your
code, you should be aware

434
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,620
that your code can
have a knock-on effect.

435
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,380
>> When Mark was sitting here in his
dorm room writing Facebook 1.0,

436
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,050
I'm pretty sure he had a view
that it was going to be huge.

437
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,945
But how huge it would be on the
environment is a big dealio.

438
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:58,340
And so all of ya'll could
come up with algorithms

439
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,370
that could be the next challenging
thing for folks like me,

440
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,700
trying to run systems.

441
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,360
>> So let's just think about
real world power limits.

442
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,930
This paper by Landauer--
is not a new thing.

443
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,480
1961 this was published
in the IBM Journal.

444
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,590
This is the canonical
"Irreversibility and Heat

445
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,630
Generation in the Computing Process."

446
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:22,050
And so he argued that
machines inevitably

447
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,070
perform logistic functions that
don't have single-valued inverse.

448
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,130
>> So that the whole part of
this is that back in the '60s,

449
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,890
folks knew that this was
going to be a problem.

450
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:37,080
And so the law of limits said 25
degrees C, a sort of canonical room

451
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,120
temperature, the limit
represents 0.1 electron volts.

452
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,920
But theoretically, this is
the theory, computer memory,

453
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:51,410
operating at this limit could be
changed at one billion bits a second.

454
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,620
>> I don't know about you, but not
come across many one billion bits

455
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,190
a second data rate exchanges.

456
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,360
The argument there was that only
2.8 trillions of a watt of power

457
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,180
ought to ever be expanded.

458
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,160
>> All right, real world example--
this is my electric bill.

459
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,347
I'm 65% percent of
that lovely data center

460
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:11,930
I showed you, in this particular time.

461
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,520
This is back in June last year.

462
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,300
I've taken an older version so that we
can and sort of anonymize a little bit.

463
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,470
I was spending $45,000 a
month for energy there.

464
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:34,990
>> So the reason being there is that we
have over 50,000 processes in room.

465
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,110
So could you imagine your own
residential electricity bill

466
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,540
being that high?

467
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:46,180
But it was for a 199 million
watt hours over a month.

468
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:51,670
>> So the question I pose is, can you
imagine Mr. Zuckerberg's electric bill?

469
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:54,730
Mine is pretty big, and I struggle.

470
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,600
And I'm not alone in this is.

471
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,450
There's a lot of people
with big data centers.

472
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:04,800
And so, I guess, full disclosure--
my Facebook friends a little bit odd.

473
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,900
>> So my Facebook friend is
the Prineville data center,

474
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:14,030
which is one of Facebook's largest,
newest, lowest energy data center.

475
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:19,360
And they post to me, things like
power utilization effectiveness,

476
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,020
as in how effective is the data
center versus how much energy you're

477
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,370
putting into it, how much
water are they using, what's

478
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,810
the humidity and temperature.

479
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,980
>> And they have these
lovely, lovely plots.

480
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,600
I think this is an
awesome Facebook page,

481
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,400
but I guess I'm a little bit weird.

482
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,930
>> So one more power thing,
research computing that I do

483
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,060
is significantly different to
what Facebook and Yahoo and Google

484
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:50,020
and other on-demand, fully,
always available services.

485
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:53,530
And so I have the advantage that when
ISO New England-- and ISO New England

486
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,910
helps set the energy
rates for the region.

487
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,110
>> And it says it's extending
a request to consumers

488
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,870
to voluntarily conserve high energy,
because of the high heat and humidity.

489
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,680
And this was back on the 18th of July.

490
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,600
And so I happily Tweet back, Hey,
ISO New England, Green Harvard.

491
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,880
We're doing our part over
here in research computing.

492
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,760
And this is because we're doing science.

493
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,380
>> And as much as people say science
never sleeps, science can wait.

494
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,030
So we are able to quiesce our
systems, take advantage of grade rates

495
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:30,550
on our energy bill, and
help the entire New England

496
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:35,910
region by shedding
many megawatts of load.

497
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:40,020
So that's the unique thing that
differs about scientific computing data

498
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:48,890
centers and those that are
in full production 24/7.

499
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,670
>> So let's just take another gear here.

500
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,170
So, I want to discuss
chaos a little bit.

501
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,900
And I want to put it in
the auspices of storage.

502
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,150
So for those that kind
of were struggling

503
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:08,680
getting their head around what petabytes
of storage look like, this an example.

504
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,660
And this is the sort of stuff
I deal with all the time.

505
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,550
>> Each one of these little fellas
is a four terabyte hard drive,

506
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,420
so you can kind of count them up.

507
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,370
We're getting now between
one to 1 and 1/2 petabytes

508
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,970
in a standard industry rack.

509
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,430
And we have rooms and rooms, as you
saw in that earlier picture with John

510
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,230
and I, full of these racks of equipment.

511
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:40,400
So it's becoming very, very easy
to build massive storage arrays

512
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,140
>> It's mostly easy inside of Unix to
kind of count up how things are going.

513
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,270
So this is counting how many
MAU points have I got there.

514
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:50,880
So that's 423 intercept points.

515
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,660
And then if I run some sketchy awk, I
can add up, in this particular system,

516
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,080
there was 7.3 petabytes
of available storage.

517
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,350
>> So that's a lot of stuff.

518
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,030
And storage is really hard.

519
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,850
And yet, for some reason,
this is an industry trend.

520
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,500
Whenever I talk to our researchers
and our faculty and say,

521
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,180
hey, I can run storage for you.

522
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,690
Unfortunately, I have to
recover the cost of the storage.

523
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,430
I get this business.

524
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,300
And people reference Newegg
or they reference Staples

525
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,040
or how much they can buy a
single terabyte disk drive for.

526
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,390
>> So this, you'll note
here, that there's a clue.

527
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,310
There's one disk drive here.

528
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,290
And if we go back, I have many.

529
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:36,130
Not only do I have many, I have
sophisticated interconnects

530
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,750
to be able to stitch
these things together.

531
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:44,080
So the risk associated with these large
storage arrays is not insignificant.

532
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,370
>> In fact, we took to the
internet and we wrote

533
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:51,670
a little story about a well-meaning,
mild-mannered director of research

534
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,640
computing-- happens to have a
strange English accent-- trying

535
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,930
to explain to a researcher what the
no underscore backup folder actually

536
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,070
meant.

537
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,690
It was quite a long, little story,
a good four minutes of discovery.

538
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:09,380
>> And note, I have an awful
lot less space than the lady

539
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,800
that sings about all the bass.

540
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,910
We're quite a few accounts lower.

541
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,160
But anyway, this is an
important thing to think about,

542
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,532
in terms of what could go wrong.

543
00:31:18,532 --> 00:31:20,990
So if I get a disk drive, and
I throw it in a Unix machine,

544
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:24,300
and I start writing things to it,
there's a magnet, there's a drive head,

545
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,150
there's ostensibly, a one or a zero
being written down on to that device.

546
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,180
>> Motors-- spinny, twirly
things always break.

547
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,490
Think about things that break.

548
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,170
It's always been spinny, twirly things.

549
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:38,560
Printers, disk drives,
motor vehicles, etc.

550
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,590
Anything that moves is likely to break.

551
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,575
>> So you need motors, you
need drive firmware,

552
00:31:42,575 --> 00:31:47,110
you need SAS/SATA controllers, wires,
firmware on the SAS/SATA controllers,

553
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,530
low level blocks.

554
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:54,580
Pick your storage controller file
system code, whichever one it may be,

555
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,780
how you stitch things together.

556
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,956
And your virtual memory manager
pages, DRAM fetch and stores.

557
00:32:00,956 --> 00:32:02,705
Then, you get another
stack, which is kind

558
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,440
of down the list on this
one, algorithms, users.

559
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,050
>> And if you multiply this
up, I don't know how many,

560
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,640
there's a lot of places
where stuff can go sideways.

561
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,430
I mean, that's an example about math.

562
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,070
But it's kind of fun to think of
how many ways things could go wrong,

563
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,650
just for a disk drive.

564
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,440
We're already at 300 petabytes, so
imagine the number of disk drives

565
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,741
you need at 300 petabytes
that can go wrong.

566
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:28,240

567
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,390
Not only that-- so that's storage.

568
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,220
And that alludes to the
person I'd like to see

569
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,780
enter stage left, which
is the Chaos Monkey.

570
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,140
So at a certain point, it gets even
bigger than just the disk drive

571
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:43,920
problem.

572
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:50,610
>> And so, these fine ladies and gentleman
that run a streaming video service

573
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:55,430
realized that their computers were
also huge and also very complicated

574
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,010
and also providing service
to an awful a lot of people.

575
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:05,180
They've got 37 million members-- and
this slide's maybe a year or so old--

576
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,350
thousands of devices.

577
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,810
There are billions of hours of video.

578
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,600
They log billions of events a day.

579
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,330
>> And you can see, most people watch
the telly later on in the evening,

580
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,429
and it far outweighs everything.

581
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:21,220
And so, they wanted to
be able to make sure

582
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,854
that the service was up and
reliable and working for them.

583
00:33:24,854 --> 00:33:27,020
So they came up with this
thing called Chaos Monkey.

584
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,000
It's piece of software
which, when you think

585
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,190
about talking about the title
of this whole presentation,

586
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,530
scale-out means you
should test this stuff.

587
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,585
It's no good just having
a million machines.

588
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:40,460
So the nice thing about
this is, Chaos Monkey

589
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,090
is a service which
identifies groups of systems

590
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,220
and randomly terminates one
of the systems in a group.

591
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,429
Awesome.

592
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:50,220
So I don't know about
you, but if I've ever

593
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,990
built a system that relies on other
systems talking to each other,

594
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:55,865
you take one of them out, the
likelihood of the entire thing working,

595
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:57,130
diminishes rapidly.

596
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,475
>> And so this piece of software runs
around Netflix's infrastructure.

597
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:03,100
Luckily, it says it runs only in
business hours with the intent

598
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,810
that engineers will be
alert and able to respond.

599
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,020
So these are the types
of things we're now

600
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,360
having to do to perturb our computing
environments, to introduce chaos

601
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,739
and to introduce complexity.

602
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:19,139
>> So who, in their right
mind, would willingly choose

603
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,540
to work with a Chaos Monkey?

604
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,150
Hang on, he seems to be pointing me.

605
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:28,719
Well, I guess I should-- cute.

606
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,909
But the problem is you
don't get the choice.

607
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:37,440
The Chaos Monkey, as you
can see, chooses you.

608
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,650
>> And this is the problem with computing
at scale is that you can't avoid this.

609
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:49,989
It's an inevitability of complexity
and of scale and of our evolution,

610
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:53,280
in some ways, of computing expertise.

611
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,510
And remember, this is
one thing to remember,

612
00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:00,030
Chaos Monkeys love
snowflakes-- love snowflakes.

613
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,470
A snowflake-- we've explained the
Chaos Monkey-- but a snowflake

614
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:09,630
is a server that is unique and
special and delicate and individual

615
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,770
and will never be reproduced.

616
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,790
>> We often find snowflake
service in our environment.

617
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,700
And we always try and
melt snowflake service.

618
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,880
But if you find a server
in your environment

619
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,240
that is critical to the longevity
of your organization and it melts,

620
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,300
you can't put it back together again.

621
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,071
So Chaos Monkey's job was to
go and terminate instances.

622
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:30,820
If the Chaos Monkey melts the
snowflake, you're over, you're done.

623
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,390

624
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,950
I want to talk about
some hardware that we're

625
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,415
seeing in terms of sort of
scale-out activities too.

626
00:35:40,415 --> 00:35:43,810
And some unique things that are in
and around the science activity.

627
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,990
We are now starting to see, remember
this unit of issue, this rack?

628
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:51,780
So this is a rack of GPGPUs-- so general
purpose graphics processing units.

629
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,790
>> We have these located in our data
center, 100 or so miles away.

630
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,780
This particular rack
is about 96 tera FLOPS

631
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,090
of single-precision math able
to deliver out the back of it.

632
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:10,530
And we have order 130-odd
cards in an instance

633
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:16,620
that we-- multiple
racks of this instance.

634
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:22,730
>> So this is interesting in the sense that
the general purpose graphics processes

635
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:27,880
are able to do mathematics incredibly
quickly for very low amounts of energy.

636
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,060
So there's a large uptick in
the scientific computing areas,

637
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,400
looking at graphics
processing units in a big way.

638
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,990
>> So I ran some Mcollective
through our puppet infrastructure

639
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,330
yesterday, very excited about this.

640
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,260
just short of a petaflop
of single-precision.

641
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,440
Just to be clear here , this
little multiplier is 3.95.

642
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,820
Double-precision math
would be about 1.2,

643
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,010
but my Twitter feed
looked way better if I

644
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:02,670
said we had almost a petaflop
of single-precision GPGPUs.

645
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,220
>> But it's getting there.

646
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,280
It's getting to be
very, very impressive.

647
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,550
And why are we doing this?

648
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,570
Because quantum chemistry,
among other things,

649
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,300
but we're starting to design
some new photovoltaics.

650
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,210
>> And so Alan Aspuru-Guzik, who's a
professor in chemistry-- my partner

651
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,390
in crime-- for the last few years.

652
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:25,660
We've been pushing the
envelope on computing.

653
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,250
And the GPGPU is ideal
technology to be able to do

654
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:34,760
an awful lot of complicated
math, very, very quickly.

655
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,750
>> So with scale, comes new challenges.

656
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,070
So huge scale-- you have to be
careful how you wire this stuff.

657
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:45,300
And we have certain levels of
obsessive compulsive disorder.

658
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,530
These pictures probably
drive a lot of people nuts.

659
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,390
And cabinets that aren't
wired particularly well

660
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,050
drive our network and
facilities engineers nuts.

661
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,620
Plus there's also airflow
issues that you have to contain.

662
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,430
>> So these are things that I
would never have thought of.

663
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,480
With scale, comes more complexity.

664
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,869
This is a new type of file system.

665
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:06,410
It's awesome.

666
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,660
It's a petabyte.

667
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,905
It can store 1.1 billion files.

668
00:38:09,905 --> 00:38:15,940
It can read and write to 13 gigabytes
and 20 gigabytes a second-- gigabytes

669
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,150
a second.

670
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,900
So it can unload terabytes
in no time at all.

671
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,070
>> And it's highly available.

672
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,989
And it's got amazing lookup
rates-- 220,000 lookups a second.

673
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:29,780
And there are many different people
building these kind of systems.

674
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,830
And you can see it here graphically.

675
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,800
This is one of our file systems
that's under load, quite

676
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,250
happily reading at just short
of 22 gigabytes a second.

677
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,790
So that's cool-- so complexity.

678
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:47,230
>> So with complexity and scale,
comes more complexity, right?

679
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,830
This is one of our many,
many network diagrams,

680
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,970
where you have many different
chassis all supporting up

681
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,730
into a main core switch,
connected to storage,

682
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,731
connecting to low latency interconnects.

683
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:03,605
And then all of this side of the
house, is just all of the management

684
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:09,740
that you need to be able to address
these systems from a remote location.

685
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,070
So scale has a lot of
complexity with it.

686
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:14,910

687
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:17,785
>> Change gear again, let's go back
and have a little spot of science.

688
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:21,450
So, remember, research
computing and this little shim--

689
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,310
little pink shim between the
faculty and all of their algorithms

690
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:30,650
and all of the cool science and all of
this power and cooling and data center

691
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:35,330
floor and networking and big computers
and service desks and help desks

692
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:39,330
and so forth-- and so, we're just
this little shim between them.

693
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:42,820
>> What we've started to
see is that the world's

694
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,730
been able to build
these large data centers

695
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,020
and be able to build
these large computers.

696
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,420
We've gotten pretty good at it.

697
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,600
What we're not very good at is this
little shim between the research

698
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,670
and the bare metal and the technology.

699
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,600
And it's hard.

700
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,330
>> And so we've been able to hire
folks that live in this world.

701
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:07,590
And more recently, we spoke to the
National Science Foundation and said,

702
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,440
this scale-out stuff is great,
but we can't get our scientists

703
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,690
on to these big complicated machines.

704
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,040
And so, there have been a
number of different programs

705
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,100
where we really were mostly
concerned about trying

706
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,800
to see if we could transform
the campus infrastructure.

707
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,850
>> There are a lot of programs
around national centers.

708
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:28,300
And so, ourselves, our
friends at Clemson,

709
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,620
University of Wisconsin Madison,
Southern California, Utah, and Hawaii

710
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,780
kind of got together to
look at this problem.

711
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,340
And this little graph here
is the long tail of science.

712
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,602
>> So this is-- it doesn't
matter what's on this axis,

713
00:40:41,602 --> 00:40:45,485
but this axis is actually number
of jobs going through the cluster.

714
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,940
So there's 350,000 over
whatever time period.

715
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,730
These are our usual suspects
along the bottom here.

716
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,992
In fact, there's Alan Aspuru-Guzik,
who we were just talking about-- tons

717
00:40:55,992 --> 00:40:58,700
and tons of compute, really
effective, knows what he's doing.

718
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,840
>> Here's another lab that I'll talk
about in a moment-- John Kovac's lab .

719
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,610
They've got it.

720
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,210
They're good.

721
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:04,830
They're happy.

722
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,960
They're computing.

723
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,664
Great science is getting done .

724
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:09,580
And then, as you kind
of come down here, there

725
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,110
are other groups that
aren't running many jobs.

726
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,410
>> And why is that?

727
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,080
Is it because the computing is too hard?

728
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,580
Is it because they don't know how to?

729
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,880
We don't know, because
we've gone and looked.

730
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,620
And so that's what this
project is all about,

731
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,830
is locally, within
each of these regions,

732
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,660
to look to avenues where we can engage
with the faculty and researchers

733
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,400
actually in the bottom end of the tail,
and understand what they're doing.

734
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,920
>> So that's something that we're
actually passionate about.

735
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
And that's something that
science won't continue

736
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,260
to move forward until we solve
some of these edge cases.

737
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,590
Other bits of science
that's going up-- everyone

738
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,260
seen the Large Hadron Collider.

739
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,540
Awesome, right?

740
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,960
This stuff all ran out at Holyoke.

741
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,510
We built-- the very first
science that happened in Holyoke

742
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,130
was the collaboration between
ourselves and Boston University.

743
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,510
So it's really, really cool.

744
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:04,410
>> This is a fun piece
of science for scale.

745
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,650
This is a digital access to
a sky century at Harvard.

746
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,170
Basically, it's a plate archive.

747
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,350
If you go down Oxford--
Garden Street, sorry,

748
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:16,560
you'll find one of the observatory
buildings is basically full

749
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,480
of about half a million plates.

750
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:24,410
>> And these are pictures of the
sky at night, over 100 years.

751
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:28,760
So there's a whole rig set up
here to digitize those plates,

752
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,100
take pictures of them, register
them, put them on a computer.

753
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,410
And that's a petabyte and a half,
just right there-- one small project.

754
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,530
>> These are other projects.

755
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:42,800
This Pan-STARRS project is doing
a full wide panoramic survey,

756
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,390
looking for near Earth asteroids
and transient celestial events.

757
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,100
As a molecular biophysicist, I love
the word transient celestial event.

758
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,050
I'm not quite sure what it is, but
anyway, we're looking for them.

759
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:00,372
>> And we're generating 30 terabytes
a night out of those telescopes.

760
00:43:00,372 --> 00:43:03,330
And that's not really a bandwidth
problem, that's like a FedEx problem.

761
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:08,420
So you put the storage on the van
and you send it whatever it is.

762
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,570
>> BICEP is really interesting--
so background imaging

763
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:13,850
of cosmic extra galactic polarization.

764
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,880
When I first started working
at Harvard seven or so,

765
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,440
eight years ago, I remember
working on this project

766
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,010
and it didn't really sink
home as to why polarized light

767
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,770
from the cosmic microwave
background would be important,

768
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,800
until this happened.

769
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,580
>> And this was John Kovac,
who I talked to before,

770
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:42,030
using millions upon millions of CPU
hours, in our facility and others,

771
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:46,600
to basically stare into the inside
of the universe's first moments

772
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,150
after the Big Bang, and
trying to understand

773
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,290
Einstein's general theory of relativity.

774
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:56,040
It's mind blowing that our computers
are helping us unravel and stare

775
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,280
into the very origins of why we're here.

776
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,450
>> So when you talk about scale,
this is some serious scale.

777
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:09,260
The other thing of scale is, that
particular project hit these guys.

778
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:15,320
And this is the response curve for BICEP
[INAUDIBLE] This was our little survey.

779
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:19,220
>> And you can see here, life
was good until about here,

780
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,200
which was when the
announcement came out.

781
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,120
And you have got literally
seconds to respond

782
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:29,020
to the scaling event which
corresponds to this little dot here,

783
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:32,200
which ended up shifting
four or so terabytes of data

784
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,370
through the web server
that day-- pretty hairy.

785
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,210
>> And so, these are the
types of things that

786
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:43,040
can happen to you in your infrastructure
if you do not design for scale.

787
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,630
We had a bit of a
scramble that day, to be

788
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:50,440
able to span out enough web service
to keep the site up and running.

789
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,399
And we were successful.

790
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,190
This is a little email
that's kind of cute.

791
00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:00,245
This is a mail to Mark Vogelsberger,
and Lars Hernquist, who's

792
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:02,650
a faculty member here at Harvard.

793
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:03,570
More about Mark later.

794
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,990
But I think this is one
sort of sums up kind

795
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:09,920
of where the computing
is in research computing.

796
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,070
Hey, team, since last
Tuesday, you guys racked up

797
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,470
over 28% of the new
cluster, which combined

798
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:20,040
is over 78 years of
CPU in just three days.

799
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,502
And I said, it's still
only just Friday morning.

800
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:23,460
This is pretty awesome!

801
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,740
Happy Friday!

802
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,450
>> Then I give them the data points.

803
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,260
And so that was kind of interesting.

804
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:34,840
So remember about Mark, he'll come
back into the picture in a little bit.

805
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,935
So scale-out computing is everywhere.

806
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:41,080
>> We're even helping folks look
at how the NBA functions,

807
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:43,140
and where people are
throwing balls from.

808
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,580
I don't really understand this game too
well, but seemingly, it's a big deal.

809
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,610
There's hoops and bowls and money.

810
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:55,300
>> And so, our database, we
built a little 500 [INAUDIBLE]

811
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,170
parallel processor cluster,
a couple of terabytes of RAM,

812
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:03,590
to be able to build this
for Kirk and his team.

813
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:08,524
And they're doing computing
in a whole other way.

814
00:46:08,524 --> 00:46:10,440
Now this is project we're
involved with that's

815
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,880
absolutely fascinating, around neural
plasticity connectomics and genomic

816
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,960
imprinting-- three very heavy
hitting areas of research

817
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,650
that we fight with on
a day-to-day basis.

818
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:30,670
The idea that our brains are under
plastic stress when we are young.

819
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,980
And much of our adult behavior is
sculpted by experience in infancy.

820
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,040
So this is a big dealio.

821
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,360
>> And so this is work that's funded by the
National Institutes of Mental Health.

822
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,860
And we are trying to basically,
through a lot of large data

823
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,970
and big data analysis, kind
of peer into our human brain

824
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,870
through a variety of
different techniques.

825
00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:00,360
>> So I wanted to stop and kind of
just pause for a little moment.

826
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,160
The challenge with remote
data centers is it's far away.

827
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,520
It can't possibly work.

828
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,590
I need my data close by.

829
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,730
I need to do my research in my lab.

830
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:18,620
>> And so I kind of took an example of a
functional magnetic resonance imaging

831
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,260
data set from our data
center in Western Mass.

832
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,660
and connected it to my
desktop in Cambridge.

833
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,440
And I'll play this little video.

834
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,750
Hopefully it will kind of work.

835
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:33,480
>> So this is me going through
checking my GPUs are working.

836
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,430
And I'm checking that VNC's up.

837
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:36,810
And this is a clever VNC.

838
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,970
This is a VNC with 3D pieces.

839
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,975
And so, as you can see shortly, this
is me spinning this brain around.

840
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:44,460
I'm trying to kind of get it oriented.

841
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,574
And then I can move through many
different slices of MRI data.

842
00:47:49,574 --> 00:47:51,490
And the only thing that's
different about this

843
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:55,160
is, it's coming over the wire
from Western Mass. to my desktop.

844
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,300
And its rendering
faster than my desktop,

845
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:02,840
because I don't have a $4,000
graphics card in my desktop, which

846
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,262
we have out Western Mass.

847
00:48:04,262 --> 00:48:05,720
Of course, I'm trying to be clever.

848
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,859
I'm running GLX gears in the
background, whilst doing all this,

849
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:10,900
to make sure that I can
stress the graphics card,

850
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:14,140
and that it all kind of
works and all the rest of it.

851
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,700
But the important thing is,
is this is 100 miles away.

852
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,460
And you can see from this that
there's no obvious latency.

853
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,600
Things holding together fairly well.

854
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,907
>> And so that, in and of itself,
is an example and some insight

855
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:31,490
into how computing and scale-out
computing is going to happen.

856
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:35,330
We're all working on
thinner and thinner devices.

857
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,870
Our use of tablets is increasing.

858
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,160
>> So therefore, my carbon
footprint is basically

859
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,060
moving from what used
to do that would've

860
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,060
been a huge machine
under my desk, to what

861
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,550
is now a facility-- could be anywhere.

862
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,800
It could be anywhere at all.

863
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,790
And yet, it's still able to bring
back high performance graphics

864
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,630
to my desktop.

865
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,900
>> So, getting near the
end-- remember Mark?

866
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,480
Well, smart lad is Mark.

867
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,360
He decided that he was going to
build a realistic virtual universe.

868
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:12,820
That's quite a project, when you
think you've got to pitch this.

869
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,740
I'm going to use a
computer, and I'm going

870
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:21,040
to model the 12 million years after
the Big Bang to represent a day.

871
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:27,080
And then I'm going to do 13.8
billion years of cosmic evolution.

872
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,270
All right.

873
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,970
>> This actually uses a computer
the was bigger than our computer,

874
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,040
and it spilled over onto the national
resources to our friends down in Texas.

875
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,820
And to the national facilities,
this was a lot of compute.

876
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,750
But we did a lot of
the simulation locally

877
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,820
to make sure that the software
worked and the systems worked.

878
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:47,790
>> And it's days like this when you
realize that you're supporting science

879
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:51,090
at this level of scale, that
people can now say things

880
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,840
like, I'm going to a model a universe.

881
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,145
And this is his first model.

882
00:49:54,145 --> 00:49:56,422
And this is his team's first model.

883
00:49:56,422 --> 00:49:58,130
There are many other
folks that are going

884
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:01,520
to come behind Mark, who are going to
want to model with high resolution,

885
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,652
with more specificity,
with more accuracy.

886
00:50:04,652 --> 00:50:09,105
>> And so, in the last couple of minutes,
I just want to show you this video

887
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:15,270
of Mark and Lars's that to me, again,
as a life scientist , is kind of cute.

888
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,890

889
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,970
So this, at the bottom
here, to orient you,

890
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,640
this is telling you the
time since the Big Bang.

891
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,570
So we're at about 0.7 billion years.

892
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,740
And this is showing the current update.

893
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,450
So you're seeing at the moment,
dark matter and the evolution

894
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:39,910
of the fine structure and early
structures in our known universe.

895
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:45,690
>> And the point with this is that this
is all done inside the computer.

896
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,530
This is a set of parameters
and a set of physics

897
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:52,840
and a set of mathematics
and a set of models

898
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:59,284
that are carefully selected, and then
carefully connected to each other

899
00:50:59,284 --> 00:51:00,825
to be able to model the interactions.

900
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:04,850
>> So you can see some starts of
some gaseous explosions here.

901
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,880
And gas temperature is changing.

902
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:13,720
And you can start to see the structure
of the visible universe change.

903
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:18,130
And the important part with this
is, each little tiny, tiny, tiny dot

904
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:21,070
is a piece of physics and has
a set of mathematics around,

905
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:23,030
informing its friend and its neighbor.

906
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:27,245
>> So from a scaling perspective, these
computers have to all work in concert

907
00:51:27,245 --> 00:51:29,470
and talk to each other efficiently.

908
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:31,060
So they can't be too chatty.

909
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,520
They have to store their results.

910
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,902
And they have to continue to
inform all of their friends.

911
00:51:37,902 --> 00:51:40,860
Indeed, you'll see now, this model's
getting more and more complicated.

912
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:42,590
There's more and more stuff going on.

913
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,210
There's more and more
material flying around.

914
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,410
>> And this is what the early
cosmos would've looked like.

915
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,770
It was a pretty hairy place.

916
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:55,140
There's explosions all over
the place, powerful collisions.

917
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,620
And formation of heavy
metals and elements.

918
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:03,910
And these big clouds smashing into
each other with the extreme force.

919
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:08,530
>> And so now we're 9.6 billion
years from this initial explosion.

920
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,310
You're starting to see things are
kind of calmed down a little bit, just

921
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:15,660
a little bit, because the
energy is now starting to relax.

922
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:19,420
And so the mathematical
models have got that in place.

923
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,510
And you're starting to see
coalescence of different elements.

924
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,220
And starting to see this thing kind
of come together and slowly cool.

925
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:32,260
>> And it's starting to look a little bit
more like the night sky, a little bit.

926
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:37,870
And it's [? QSing. ?] We're now 30.2
billion years and we're kind of done.

927
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:41,130
And then what they did was
that they took this model,

928
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,580
and then looked at the visible universe.

929
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:48,560
And basically then, were
able to take that and overlay

930
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,580
it with what you can see.

931
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:56,160
And the fidelity is staggering, as to
how accurate the computer models are.

932
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,760
>> Of course, the astrophysicists
and the research groups

933
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,780
need even better fidelity
and even higher resolution.

934
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,230
But if you think about what
I've been talking to you today

935
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:11,850
through this little voyage through both
storage and structure and networking

936
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:18,000
and stacks, the important thing is,
is scale-out computing essential?

937
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,050
That was my original hypothesis--
back to our scientific method.

938
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:24,810
>> I hope that at the early
part of this I would

939
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:29,400
predict that I would be able to explain
to you about scale-out computing.

940
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,870
And we kind of tested
some of those hypotheses.

941
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:34,585
We went through this conversation.

942
00:53:34,585 --> 00:53:38,920
And I'm just going to say scale-out
computing is essential-- oh,

943
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,480
yes, very much yes.

944
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,790
>> So when you're thinking
about your codes, when

945
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:49,230
you're doing the CS50 final projects,
when you're thinking about your legacy

946
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,990
to humanity and the resources that we
need to be able to run these computer

947
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:56,650
systems, think very carefully
about the FLOPS per watt,

948
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,560
and think about the Chaos Monkey.

949
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:02,240
>> Think about your snowflakes, don't
do one-offs, reuse libraries,

950
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:06,453
build reusable codes-- all of the things
that the tutors have been teaching you

951
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:08,630
in this class.

952
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,942
These are fundamental aspects.

953
00:54:11,942 --> 00:54:13,150
They're not just lip service.

954
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:15,660
These are real things.

955
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:20,680
>> And if any of you want to follow me,
I am obsessive with the Twitter thing.

956
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,770
I've got to somehow give that up.

957
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,960
But a lot of the
background information is

958
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:29,260
on our research computing
website at rc.fas.harvard.edu.

959
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,010
>> I try and keep a blog up to
date with modern technologies

960
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:38,390
and how we do distributive
computing and so forth.

961
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:43,600
And then our staff are always
available through odybot.org.

962
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,270
And odybot is our little helper.

963
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,280
He often has little
contests on his website

964
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,630
too, where you can try and
spot him around campus.

965
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:55,200
He's the friendly little
face of research computing.

966
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,730
>> And I'll kind of wrap up there
and thank you all for your time.

967
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:05,660
And I hope you remember that
scale-out computing is a real thing.

968
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:08,162
And there are a lot of people
who've got a lot of prior art

969
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,370
who will be able to help you.

970
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:14,330
And all of the best of luck with
your future endeavors in making

971
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:18,280
sure that our computing both
scales, is high performing,

972
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,370
and helps humanity more
than anything else.

973
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,850
So, thank you for your time.

974
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:23,947
