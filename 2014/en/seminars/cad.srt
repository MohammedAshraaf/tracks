1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,712

2
00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:08,260
>> ANSEL DUFF: All right, hi, everybody.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,140
My name's Ansel.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,260
I am, as you know, a senior in
mechanical engineering in [INAUDIBLE].

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,260
Today, we're going to
spend a little bit of time

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,220
reviewing how to design
a part from scratch

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,690
and how to ensure that it will suit the
needs of whatever its application may

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,190
be.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,210
>> So today, we will first design
this little lens support.

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,310
I have a couple of
them printed out here.

11
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:33,710
And I have one actually attached to the
mount that I just sat down right here.

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,790
And this just holds up a lens
like so, mounts onto some

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,470
rails-- I don't have enough hands
to hold this-- just like that.

14
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,940
So we'll go over how that
was designed, and then

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,260
move on to another
part, which is an iPhone

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,260
dock, which I've
displayed here, in orange.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,760
We'll go over how to CAD
those, how they were designed,

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,510
how to take measurements, and how
to ensure that this won't tip over,

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,030
for example, or this
won't buckle under loads.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,320
>> All right, so before
we get started, I just

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,060
want to talk about some
overarching design principles

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,387
when you're designing
a part from scratch.

23
00:01:08,387 --> 00:01:10,220
Much like when you're
writing code, you want

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,590
to be very explicit in
what you tell the computer.

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,490
You never want to leave
anything ambiguous.

26
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,914
Luckily for us, in SolidWorks,
when you sketch something,

27
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:21,080
all the lines are blue when
you initially draw them,

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,686
and they become black once they're
constrained in three dimensional space.

29
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:26,810
So if you have a sketch
with some blue lines on it,

30
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,726
you know that you need to fix some
of those things before you move on.

31
00:01:29,726 --> 00:01:33,680
It's just like a sanity check before
you make a picture out of a sketch.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,270
>> So like I said, you want to
be really explicit in how

33
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,871
the sketches are defined.

34
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:41,120
The way that it works is you
start out with one point.

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,590
SolidWorks gives you an origin
in three dimensional space.

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,610
And that point is fixed.

37
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,750
And it will always be there and
will never move, ever, ever, ever.

38
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,380
So you base your whole
sketch around this one point.

39
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,032
And then you relate every line to
either the origin or another line

40
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:55,240
that's related to the origin.

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,365
So I know this sounds a little abstract
right now, but once we get started,

42
00:01:58,365 --> 00:01:59,730
it'll be a little bit clearer.

43
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,430
But just like I said, make
sure that everything is black,

44
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,730
everything is completely
defined, before we move on

45
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,270
and you won't run into problems later.

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,400
>> Another thing that I'm really big
on is putting a lot of emphasis

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,370
on making sure that you design your part
for scalability such that you can tweak

48
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,540
it later if a measurement is a little
bit off with no negative consequences

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,360
or effects.

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,240
And the way do we do that is
we add a lot of relations.

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,670
So for example, when we define this
part, we have two parallel faces here.

52
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,190
Well, we told SolidWorks
that they are parallel,

53
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,050
and you can draw two parallel
lines, and SolidWorks

54
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,560
will snap your lines to a grid.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,290
But unless you explicitly
tell it that these lines need

56
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,640
to be parallel, maybe later on down
the road when you try to extend the top

57
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,690
or maybe extend the base, if you
hadn't added that relation in,

58
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,520
everything can become a mess.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,890
>> So let's get started here.

60
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,062
And if at any point you have a question,
please feel free to interrupt me.

61
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,020
It goes without saying.

62
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,290
But we'll get started.

63
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,680
So SolidWorks comes with tutorials
that teach you the syntax of the GUI.

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
I think it would not be an
efficient use of our time

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,290
to go over which buttons to click.

66
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,910
So I'll go very slowly today and walk
through every step that I'm taking.

67
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,680
But just know that if you
feel lost or confused,

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,220
there are tutorials that explain
exactly what I'm doing here

69
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,070
but on a little bit of a lower level.

70
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,820
And I'm going to put
a lot emphasis today

71
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,627
on adding relations to everything.

72
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:25,960
I'm going to go over that a lot.

73
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,795
You guys are going to get sick of it.

74
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:27,836
But it's super important.

75
00:03:27,836 --> 00:03:31,019
And you'll see down the road that
if we want to tweak a dimension,

76
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:31,810
it's really useful.

77
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,650
So we'll get started here.

78
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,940
We'll select new.

79
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,690
And we're going to design a part.

80
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,500
SolidWorks has three different
types of files you can have.

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,410
There are parts,
assemblies, and drawings.

82
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,900
Assemblies are just multiple
parts with relations,

83
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,690
so the parts are related to each
other in three dimensional space.

84
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,730
And then, a drawing is a document
that you might send to a machine shop

85
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,640
or whatever to actually
manufacture your part.

86
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,140
>> So we'll start with a
part here and click OK.

87
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,690
Now, we have a blank canvas.

88
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,810
So we're going to start out with this.

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,810
And what we first are going to do,
and this is true for every part,

90
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,750
is we need to create some sort
of stock, some sort of material.

91
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,340
And then, once we have the material,
we can extrude these web features.

92
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,540
I even wrote CS50 on the front of
it, and then a hole in the bottom.

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,200
So first, let's start out.

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,320
We're going to select Sketch
over here, and then Sketch again.

95
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,100
And SolidWorks prompts us
with three different planes.

96
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,390
You can add planes later on down the
road when you're designing your part.

97
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,440
But we're first going to have
these three orthogonal planes.

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,220
And we will select top plane right now.

99
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,130
Oops.

100
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,350
That was not the top plane.

101
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,700
Just go back here and--

102
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,040
>> There's always this tree
that is floating around here.

103
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,080
And this allows you to select
features of your build or planes

104
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,334
or any relations.

105
00:04:50,334 --> 00:04:51,500
And then, the part material.

106
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,410
So we're going to
sketch on the top plane.

107
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,650
So we hit top.

108
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,304
And we are normal to it.

109
00:04:56,304 --> 00:04:57,720
And then, here's our origin point.

110
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,960
So let's just make some
sort of shape here.

111
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,340
We know that there is going
to be a curve on the bottom

112
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,700
and a curve on the top.

113
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,550
So this is actually designed
to fit onto this piece here.

114
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,915
This is actually a lens support that
was given to us by our production team.

115
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,420
And it wasn't tall enough.

116
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,890
>> So the purpose of this part is actually
to just extend this a little bit

117
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,359
by-- we'd chosen two
inches, what we measured.

118
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,400
And it will just bolt on.

119
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,816
There's a hole that already
existed in the bottom of this.

120
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:28,960
So we know that we want
the width of our piece

121
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,950
to be the same as the
width of the support.

122
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,500
And then, we want the radius on the
bottom to be the same as the radius

123
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,740
here so that it fits nice and snugly.

124
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,980
And then, we'll add a hole on the
bottom that we can bolt it onto it.

125
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,070
>> So we're just going to start out with
the footprint of this feature, which

126
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,090
is just this base.

127
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,790
It's like a rectangle, but with
curves on the top and bottom.

128
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,962
I don't know if I can
make this stand up.

129
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:57,670
So to do that in SolidWorks, we
could start out with a rectangle.

130
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,870
But that won't be exactly
what we need because we

131
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,220
need a curved face on
the top and bottom.

132
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,340
So I just selected line over here.

133
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,620
And now, when you see the
pencil tool moving around now,

134
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,280
that means that we are ready to draw.

135
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,700
So we're going to start at the origin.

136
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,390
And we're going to draw vertically.

137
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,110
>> You'll notice that as the line becomes
vertical, it'll snap to vertical.

138
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,860
And you see that this little yellow
box right to the bottom right

139
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,800
of the pointer, that means that
SolidWorks is automatically

140
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,920
adding a relation for you.

141
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,100
So that's the theme of today,
what are the relations.

142
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,830
So when we click this,
you'll notice that it's black

143
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,250
because SolidWorks knows
that it's a vertical line

144
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,830
and it began at the origin.

145
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,550
But the endpoint is blue because
we didn't tell SolidWorks

146
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,950
how long the line is.

147
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,450
So we're just going to
make another one of these.

148
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,170
In fact, I'll even draw it
purposefully off vertical

149
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,930
so that we can add the relation in.

150
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,690
>> You'll notice that it
automatically wants

151
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,460
to add another line from the
endpoint of the first line.

152
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,194
So if you just double click like
I did here, we have another line.

153
00:06:57,194 --> 00:06:59,110
If you just double click,
it will cancel that.

154
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,320
So we can hit the green arrow.

155
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,237
I'm just going to delete this.

156
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:06,070
On most keyboards,
there'll be a delete key.

157
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,320
But on a laptop keyboard, you have to
hit the function key and then delete.

158
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,430
So we select it, and hit function,
delete, and it goes away.

159
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,660
So we need to add the
relation telling SolidWorks

160
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,630
that these lines are, in fact, parallel.

161
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,540
So I select one.

162
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,110
And then I'll hit the Control key,
hold it down, and select the other.

163
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,850
And then this dialogue box
pops up right near our cursor.

164
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,330
So we have a couple
different options here.

165
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,854
>> We can make them both vertical,
make them both horizontal, parallel.

166
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,270
In this case, making them
parallel and making the vertical

167
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,710
will accomplish the same task.

168
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,162
But we can just hit parallel.

169
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,370
And then, we're going to
add one more relation, which

170
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,290
is we're going to again hold down
Control, select both, and tell

171
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,500
SolidWorks that they're the same length.

172
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,750
Cool.

173
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,230
So now, what I'm going to do is
add what's called a center line.

174
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,370
>> So if we hit the line
tool and the little arrow,

175
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,940
this drop down will pop up.

176
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,090
And we have the center line option.

177
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,110
You'll know that something is a
center line because it's dashed.

178
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,610
It's not a solid line.

179
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,750
So let's draw one in.

180
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,780
And we need to tell SolidWorks that
this is going to be horizontal.

181
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,760
Cool.

182
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,330
>> So this is just going to be the
baseline upon which we will make sure

183
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,090
that these, like this
one, isn't too high up.

184
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:24,100
So it seems to have already
did that automatically.

185
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,970
But just to be safe,
we'll make it explicit.

186
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,430
So if we select this point here, and
then again, holding down Control,

187
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,460
select this line, we have the
option of making them coincident.

188
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,470
So we'll select that.

189
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,830
Do that again one more time.

190
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,320
And now, we know that these
lines are the same length.

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,230
They're parallel.

192
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,330
And they start on the same--
this will become a plane,

193
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,250
but it's a line for now.

194
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,510
>> AUDIENCE: So is it the
second one you clicked

195
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,750
on that is made coincident
with the first one, or is it--

196
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,170
>> ANSEL DUFF: So both lines have endpoints
that are coincident with this line.

197
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,370
So since everything is really simple
right now because it's orthogonal.

198
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,189
>> AUDIENCE: Is one always
moved to the other?

199
00:09:05,189 --> 00:09:05,980
ANSEL DUFF: Oh, OK.

200
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,850
Yeah, so it's the order
that you click it.

201
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,100
So if I had clicked the point
and then the line versus the line

202
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,990
and then the point, yeah.

203
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,890
But luckily, the origin
is a fixed point in space.

204
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,370
So now, we need to define
their length, which

205
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,250
we can do by clicking this smart
dimension in the upper left.

206
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,130
And then, select something
that we want to dimension.

207
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,380
So this is probably one of the
most important things in design,

208
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,040
dimension all of your pieces.

209
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,780
This is how you tell the
program how tall it's

210
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,620
going to be, what the radius is for the
top and bottom curved faces, the depth,

211
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,682
and so on and so forth.

212
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,890
And that's all done through
the smart dimension tool.

213
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,660
>> So if we click on the line,
this little arrow pops up.

214
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,740
And this can tell us once we
click, we get a prompt wherein

215
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,540
we can type that we want this
part to be 2 inches tall.

216
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,160
We had measured, and 2 inches seemed
like it would be plenty of space.

217
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,770
So we hit 2.00.

218
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,860
2 is also fine.

219
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,050
Hit Enter.

220
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,460
And then, you'll notice that
both lines are now 2 inches tall.

221
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,174
>> Now question, our first
line is completely black.

222
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,090
It has two black endpoints
and the line itself

223
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,350
is black because it's
completely constrained

224
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,760
in this two dimensional plane.

225
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,640
But this line is blue.

226
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,250
Why is that the case?

227
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,030
Why is that line blue?

228
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,902
We've told SolidWorks that it's
parallel to our original line.

229
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:26,860
AUDIENCE: How far it is
from the original line.

230
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,280
ANSEL DUFF: Exactly, correct.

231
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,591
So here's where we need to measure.

232
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:32,340
We don't know how far
this is going to be.

233
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,040
How wide is this supposed to be?

234
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,980
So we can hit Smart Dimension,
then select the first line.

235
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,420
You'll notice that it's blue.

236
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,800
Then, select the second line.

237
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720
And we get this width prompt.

238
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,740
So we can click it.

239
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,040
And SolidWorks now wants to know
how wide the part is going to be.

240
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,790
But we don't know.

241
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,510
So we have to measure.

242
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,540
So we take our part, and
we use a pair of calipers.

243
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,650
And we're going to just
measure the width here.

244
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,020
>> So calipers are a really precise way
of measuring any dimension, really.

245
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,170
They have two measuring prongs, I guess.

246
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,380
There's one on the bottom
that can measure externally.

247
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,041
So you'll clamp down on something.

248
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,790
And then, there are two prongs on
top that can measure internally,

249
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,910
like the diameter of
a hole, for example.

250
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,190
So calipers are typically good
to about a thousandth of an inch,

251
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,430
meaning that each tick
on the front face here

252
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,790
represents one thousandth of an inch.

253
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,200
Typically, engineers
will speak saying thou.

254
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,830
It's slang, almost.

255
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,450
Saying a part is 80 thou thick.

256
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,640
It's like, this is 80
thousandths of an inch, just

257
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,860
some lingo to cue you guys in on.

258
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,920
>> So since they're so
precise, the first tool,

259
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,660
or the first step when using
calipers, is you open the prongs up.

260
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,940
And then you wipe them to
eliminate any gunk that

261
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,490
will change your measurements.

262
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,520
And then, we close them.

263
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,210
And we ensure that it is zero.

264
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm not sure if you
can see all that well,

265
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,620
but once they're closed, the needle
lines up with zero pretty well.

266
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,620
So we don't need to adjust anything.

267
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,040
So now, we open them up.

268
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,730
We're going to clamp down.

269
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,870
And I'll try my best to hold it up here.

270
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,210
>> There are inch indications
on the actual stem

271
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,850
of the caliper, every tenth of an inch.

272
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,610
And then, there are hundred ticks,
thousand, so 1/10 of an inch

273
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,110
all around.

274
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,000
So we clamp down here.

275
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,280
And we see that it's just
past the one inch mark.

276
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,090
And it goes to four ticks past.

277
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:31,920
So one inch plus 4/1000 is 1.004 inches.

278
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,820
I suspect that whoever designed this
part designed it to be one inch,

279
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,970
and then the anodizing
added two thou on each side,

280
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:42,198
so 1.004 inches is our measurement.

281
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:45,054
>> AUDIENCE: How important was
the vertical height measurement

282
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:46,429
that you originally talked about?

283
00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:49,064

284
00:12:49,064 --> 00:12:51,730
ANSEL DUFF: This is kind of the
specificity of this part itself.

285
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,550
But you'll notice that there's
a bolt holding this in.

286
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,250
Two inches was more
than enough when we were

287
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,300
talking about how tall
this part should be.

288
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,008
It only really needs
to be about an inch.

289
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:05,010
We just held a tape
measure up and eyed it.

290
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,010
So we added another
inch just for safety.

291
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,430
And if it is too long, this can slide
down and accommodate that extra height.

292
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,390
So two inches was not
measured that accurately.

293
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,120
We just kind of eyed it knowing that it
could be adjusted and accommodated for.

294
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,800
So we'll enter in 1.004, hit Enter.

295
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,690
>> Cool, now both lines are black.

296
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,750
We're good to go.

297
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,130
So now, we need to put in
an arc here and an arc here.

298
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,740
Spoiler alert, this is just kind of
another specificity of this part.

299
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,070
They are the same radius
because it's just an extender.

300
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,002
So if you had made the top radius
and the bottom radius different,

301
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:42,960
you might be able to
accommodate a larger lens.

302
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,210
But that wasn't our goal here.

303
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,400
So we have no idea how
big this radius was.

304
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,200
But we knew the lens that it
was trying to accommodate.

305
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,610
So much like we had just measured
the width using our calipers,

306
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,560
we will do the same thing, if I
can get them, for our lens here.

307
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:04,840
>> So I'm just going to open them up
wide here, fit them around the lens,

308
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,180
don't press too much
because it's rubber.

309
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,400
We don't want to deflect it.

310
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:16,890
And we see this 3.465 is the width.

311
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,000
So that 3.465 is going
to be the diameter

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,020
that we are going to make these radii.

313
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,214
We're going to go over here and select
the arc tool in our shape plane.

314
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:30,380
Hit the drop down, you'll notice there
are a couple different types of arcs.

315
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,890
We're going to use
center point arc, which

316
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,150
is us defining the center
point and then two endpoints.

317
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,440
>> But as you can see,
there's also a tangent

318
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,560
and three point arc option available.

319
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,920
So let's go here and just hit
a center point arbitrarily.

320
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,270
And then, let's draw it here.

321
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,430
And I'm going to purposely
go past what we need.

322
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,960
So everything is blue
here, and that's because we

323
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,960
need to somehow make
this point be completely

324
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,390
between these two and some
specified distance away.

325
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,330
So let's add in another center line.

326
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,865
Just going to draw it vertically.

327
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:11,620
SolidWorks again snaps to vertical.

328
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,350
If you're ever wondering if in fact
this is vertical, if you select it here,

329
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,450
you'll get all the relations
on a line listed in this box.

330
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,880
>> So we see vertical, too.

331
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,080
That's telling us that the
line is in fact vertical.

332
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,560
I have the option turned off
right now to show relations.

333
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,190
Relations are shown by this
little green box with some symbol.

334
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,062
In this case, it's a vertical line.

335
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:35,020
They can get kind of
cluttered, especially when

336
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,640
you have a lot of features
happening in your drawing.

337
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,330
So I just to turn them off.

338
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,515
But if ever you need to know
the relations on a line, an arc,

339
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:45,090
a point, what have you, just select
it, and then there's a list here.

340
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,720
>> So vertical was done by SolidWorks.

341
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,910
We added in the parallel
to the second line.

342
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,740
Equal radius, equal
length was just us telling

343
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,640
SolidWorks these are
both the same length.

344
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,730
And then the distance was
specified by this one inch.

345
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,520
Cool.

346
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,290
So we will add in the center
line, can extend it down.

347
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,360
And then, we need to
tell SolidWorks that it

348
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,650
is equidistant between these two.

349
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,390
So I'm going to add in
another center line here.

350
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,260

351
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,990
>> And you'll notice that it's
coincident on both of these.

352
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,880
But we have no way yet of
saying that this line needs

353
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,000
to hit the midpoint of this line.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,820
So we can add in a point.

355
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,440
We go over here and select Point.

356
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,100
Looks like a little asterisk.

357
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,480
Then, as we move it
along this line, you'll

358
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,730
notice that there is that
yellow box in the middle of it.

359
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,110
And when we hover over
the box, the symbol

360
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,210
goes from those three lines in this
little yellow box to just two lines.

361
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,960
And that's SolidWorks's way of
saying, this is the midpoint.

362
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,790
So we make a line there,
make a dot, rather.

363
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,820
And in our relations
box, it says midpoint.

364
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,750
So we know that's in the middle.

365
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,870
And then, hit the green check.

366
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,600
Undo the point box, because it'll just
continue drawing points every time you

367
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,004
click, which we don't want.

368
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,420
So this point is already selected.

369
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,069
Now, we're going to make this
point and this line coincident.

370
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,680
So hold down Control.

371
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,819
Select this.

372
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,240
Select coincident.

373
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,349
And you're good to go.

374
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,974
Sometimes, I'm just going to undo that.

375
00:17:11,974 --> 00:17:13,990
Sometimes, when you
have these two selected,

376
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,819
that little box doesn't pop up.

377
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,060
You can always just pop
over to this left plane,

378
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,510
or left pane, rather,
and then hit coincident,

379
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,520
and it'll have the same end result.

380
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,260
Cool.

381
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,950
>> So center lines are black if
they're partially defined.

382
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,895
The end points in this are blue
because we haven't defined its length.

383
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:31,770
But we don't need to.

384
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:34,780
It's not really relevant.

385
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,870
So now, we're going to put the
center point of our arc on this line.

386
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:38,870
So we've selected it.

387
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,370
Again, hit Control.

388
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,570
Select the line.

389
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,970
Make it coincident.

390
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,110
Now, we know that this arc is
going to be symmetric to the lines.

391
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,490
And now, we're going to
make the endpoint of our arc

392
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,440
and the endpoint of our line coincident.

393
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,800
So I just was holding down
Control, selected both of those,

394
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,500
and I hit merge in the left pane.

395
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,270
And now, we have a completely
symmetric arc on the bottom.

396
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,530
>> So we need to have another one up top.

397
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,250
I'm going to highlight this
just by clicking on it.

398
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,810
And then hit Command C, and then
move the mouse away, Command V.

399
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,260
And now we have another one.

400
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,730
So again, we need to add all of our
relations just to mirror this up top.

401
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,380
And select it, or select
this center point.

402
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,130
Hit Control, select this line,
make them coincident, cool.

403
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,980
I want to just move through this.

404
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,840
All I'm doing now is I'm just
going to merge all the endpoints.

405
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,420
And then one last time.

406
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,140
Cool, so now we have two arcs.

407
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,030
>> But we need to tell SolidWorks
that they are of the same radius.

408
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:53,540
So we'll select them both and say equal.

409
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,600
Cool.

410
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,850
And now, we will finally
define their radius.

411
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,000
So I believe we said-- I don't
remember what the number was.

412
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,356
I think it was .

413
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:07,500
3.465.

414
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,120
Yeah 3.465 was our diameter.

415
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,460
But you'll notice that
we're defining the radius.

416
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:20,730
So what we're going to do
is say 3.465 divided by 2.

417
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:24,470
The dimension box can understand
algebraic expressions.

418
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,862
You can use parentheses, multiplication,
division, et cetera, et cetera.

419
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:30,570
So that's all we're
doing here because we

420
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,290
need to divide the diameter
by 2 to get the radius.

421
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,059
Hit Enter.

422
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,100
We're fully defined, we'll
notice that everything

423
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,330
is black except for this center line.

424
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:40,142
That is fine, doesn't need to be.

425
00:19:40,142 --> 00:19:41,350
So now we have our footprint.

426
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,760
We have the platform that we
will extrude to make the solid.

427
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,730
Then, once we have the solid, we
can add all the other features.

428
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,210
The hole in the bottom, this webbing to
save a little bit of material, and then

429
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,810
this bridge in the
middle that says CS50.

430
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,430
>> So we're going to exit this sketch,
and we're going to extrude it.

431
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:00,200
SolidWorks is based on
sketches and features.

432
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,160
Once you've created a sketch and
everything is completely defined,

433
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,540
you can exit the sketch and
make a feature out of it.

434
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,331
In this case, we're
going to extrude, we're

435
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,470
going to create material
from the sketch.

436
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:13,490
But when we do the hole, you'll see
that we create a sketch for the whole

437
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,400
and then make an extruded
cut from the hole.

438
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,240
So if we go over from the
top left and hit Exit Sketch,

439
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,540
we go to features pane, only
most everything is grayed out.

440
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,090
But we do have the option
to extrude boss base, which

441
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,490
is what we're going to select.

442
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:30,040
>> Once we hit this, you'll notice
that the solid actually comes out.

443
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,510
SolidWorks has some default,
maybe a tenth of an inch,

444
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,230
but we'll define the height.

445
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,209
So we hit extrude boss base.

446
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,750
Now, you'll notice that it's a solid.

447
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,770
And we need to define the
depth, this d1 over here.

448
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:45,740
So again, we're going to measure
the height using our part here.

449
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,010
We want the height to be
the same height as the arm

450
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,560
here that the part came on so that
it looks clean and does overhang.

451
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,990
There's no need for it.

452
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,390
>> So again, with our calipers,
we just measure here.

453
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,276
This is pretty similar to what
we did before and wiggle it

454
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:03,650
around a little bit, make sure
you have nice, firm grasp.

455
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,770
This is made out of aluminum, so
it's not going to deflect at all.

456
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:13,710
And we see that it is 0.751.

457
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,100
Awesome.

458
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,850
So we'll just type in 0.75.

459
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,200
And now, we have our solid.

460
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,180
So this is what will become
the lens support itself.

461
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,430
We have a couple more
features to add in.

462
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,330
>> So before, we were
sketching on the top plane.

463
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,490
But now, we can sketch on
any plane of the solid.

464
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,010
Or we could create our
own plane using what's

465
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,840
called reference geometry, which
is not necessary right now,

466
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,540
but could be later.

467
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,180
So let's just select this plane.

468
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,180
And then we're going to hit-- you'll
notice that this little box pops up

469
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,010
when you move the mouse around.

470
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,760
If you lose it, it's always
available on the top here.

471
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,420
There's this web of a box
with a little arrow beside it.

472
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,430
You'll notice that there is a plane
with an arrow coming out of it.

473
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,370
If you click this, this will make
the view that you're looking at,

474
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,400
the computer's view, normal
to the plane you've selected.

475
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,650
>> So we hit that.

476
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,460
And we have the plane that
we're going to sketch on.

477
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,921
So if we go over to the sketch
box over here we hit sketch,

478
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:12,670
SolidWorks is going to say, I don't
know which plane to sketch on.

479
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,960
Which one did you intend?

480
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,711
And it won't even let
you sketch anything.

481
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:16,918
It won't let you do anything.

482
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,800
That's why there's this error message.

483
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,830
So we hit the x.

484
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,282
We need to select the plane
first and then hit sketch.

485
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:24,240
Now, we're going to go.

486
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,300
It didn't give us any
errors or warnings.

487
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,060
So all we're going to do in this case
is really just to find some webbing.

488
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,860
And then, I made a little
bridge to say CS50.

489
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,770
We can keep that in there.

490
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,560
So one neat little
feature that we can do

491
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,480
is we can unhide the sketch
that we made for the footprint

492
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,960
and use all those
geometries in this sketch.

493
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,090
So in our feature tree, we
have this boss extrude one.

494
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,020
And then, I hit the little
plus arrow underneath it.

495
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,960
And sketch two pops up.

496
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,702
So we can-- it's always a
good idea to label things,

497
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:57,160
just like when you're writing code.

498
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,090
You want to appropriately
label your variables

499
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,880
so that it's clear
how you're using them.

500
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,630
It's the same case in
SolidWorks where you

501
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,190
want to label all your features so
that you know exactly what they do.

502
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,062
>> So if you select a feature and
then hold your mouse down over it,

503
00:23:11,062 --> 00:23:12,520
it prompts you to rename something.

504
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,320
So we'll call this base.

505
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,940
And then, same thing here, we'll
just call this sketch base.

506
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,570
So by default, once you've exited
a sketch, it becomes hidden.

507
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,620
But you can change this
just by hitting this.

508
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,370
And then, this little box will
pop up with a pair of glasses.

509
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,790
And you hit show, and now
we have everything back.

510
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,921
You can see that there
are endpoints here.

511
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:40,420
Cool.

512
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:47,160
>> So now, what we can do is we will
sketch-- we can just hit line here

513
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,630
or even I'm going to just select
all these entities, again,

514
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,140
by holding down Control.

515
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,320
And I'm going to go up
here to offset entities.

516
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,920
So we want to add some wall thickness.

517
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,350
And that can be done by just
taking the base footprint,

518
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:08,190
and then offsetting
entities on the inside.

519
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,550
>> So then, we'll specify the depth.

520
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,050
So SolidWorks, by default, goes
for the outside, apparently.

521
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,230
You could see this yellow line
around the base of our feature.

522
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,680
So if we just hit reverse, now
it becomes inside, which is cool.

523
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,010
A tenth of an inch sounds fine.

524
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,020
We hit the green arrow.

525
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,190
And we have our dimension down here.

526
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,730
Now typically, if we're defining this
part to be like a load bearing part,

527
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,190
I guess technically it is
varying the load of the lens.

528
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,505
But the plastic that
we're using to print these

529
00:24:36,505 --> 00:24:42,900
is actually pretty strong, so we're just
going to guess on the wall thickness.

530
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,670
A tenth of an inch is plenty, probably
a third of that is really required,

531
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,940
but we'll just add a little
bit more for rigidity.

532
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,740
>> If we were designing it to be
a part on, say, a race car,

533
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,890
we would run it through a computer
simulation called Finite Element

534
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,740
Analysis, FEA, wherein the computer
meshes up our part into arbitrarily

535
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,170
many little mesh segments.

536
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,940
And then, we subject it to
loads and fixtures like saying,

537
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,960
don't let the base move, but subject
the top curved face to a load of 150

538
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,440
Newtons normal to it.

539
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,040
Or I guess it's a curved face,
it can't be normal to it.

540
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,250
But downward, and then it will
tell you when the part will fail

541
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,260
and which areas of the part
are under the most stress.

542
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,920
It's overkill right now.

543
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,080
But we'll just eye it, a
tenth of an inch is plenty.

544
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,450
>> Cool, so now we have all this.

545
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:38,000
And we're going to add in another
centerline to bisect this part here.

546
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,440
Just the same procedure as before.

547
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,273
I'm going to start to
go a little bit faster

548
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,350
because this is becoming
a little repetitive.

549
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,510
We'll add a point.

550
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,140
That is the midpoint here.

551
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,990
In fact, this is even unnecessary.

552
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,870
>> We can just draw the
centerline from the midpoint.

553
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,230
So we find it.

554
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,670
That yellow box pops up.

555
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:57,930
So we hover over it.

556
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,200
Draw it across again.

557
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,130
Now, we have this line
is bisecting this line.

558
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,110
This vertical line here.

559
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,560
>> So again, we can offset entities.

560
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,720
We want to.

561
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,740
We're going to create the bridge on
which we will later extrude cut, CS50.

562
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,280
We want to add some thickness to it.

563
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,440
So we hit offset entities, and by
default, it adds a line on one side.

564
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,670
But if we just hit bidirectional,
there's a little check box down here,

565
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,120
it adds two.

566
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,890
And let's make this
a little bit thicker.

567
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:36,050
So say 0.15, maybe even a
little bit more than that.

568
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:41,960
So this is 0.2 inches on each
side, so 0.4 inches in total.

569
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,035
Can move the dimensions out of the way
so that we don't clutter the drawing.

570
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:47,950
That looks good.

571
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,810
>> Typically, when you're
dimensioning a part,

572
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,840
there are seemingly infinitely many
ways to display all the dimensions

573
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,310
on your sketch.

574
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:01,490
In the interest of not cluttering it,
it's nice to move your dimensions away.

575
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,850
And there are other rules
that kind of follow,

576
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,420
like you don't want them
to crisscross or overlap,

577
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,980
because it becomes ambiguous.

578
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,450
But this is good for now.

579
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:12,040
So hit the green arrow.

580
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,900
Now, we want to add
in this webbing, which

581
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,030
we're going to do in the same
way with offset entities.

582
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,350
>> So we hit center line.

583
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:24,400
And I'm just going to draw two
x's in here on the top and bottom.

584
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,552
Here is one.

585
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:26,885
do the same thing on the bottom.

586
00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:30,390

587
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,590
And you'll notice that
all of these lines

588
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,070
are black because all of the
points, all their endpoints,

589
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,170
are completely defined.

590
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:37,990
So that's cool.

591
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,000
We don't need to add any more relations.

592
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,370
And let's select them and
hit offset entities again.

593
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,792
And that ought to do it.

594
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:53,190
You can only do one at
a time, which is fine.

595
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:56,130
Offset entities, whoa, that looks crazy.

596
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,940

597
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,750
I accidentally selected
more than one thing.

598
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,432
Offset entities, that's weird.

599
00:28:05,432 --> 00:28:07,342
Don't know why it's doing that.

600
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:10,110

601
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,150
Hm, didn't expect that.

602
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,380
That's fine.

603
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,480
We will just do it by hand.

604
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,270
>> So we will add in-- I'm just
going to draw in some lines

605
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,010
here that we will add
relations to in a bit.

606
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:29,860

607
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,710
So we want these lines to
be parallel to this line.

608
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,200
So we just hit make parallel.

609
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,880
Then likewise, on the other side, cool.

610
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880

611
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,533
And we'll just make the endpoints match.

612
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,497
>> AUDIENCE: All of these
varied thicknesses,

613
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:51,461
is this just experience and insight?

614
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:53,916
Or is there math that's
behind the choice

615
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,862
of these thicknesses for
the structural integrity?

616
00:28:56,862 --> 00:29:00,690
>> ANSEL DUFF: Yeah, so right now, I'm
just kind of going off of instinct

617
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:03,330
and eyeing it, guessing.

618
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,640
We had made a version zero prototype.

619
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,140
It's around here, and clear.

620
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,010
And I had guessed a
tenth of an inch, and I

621
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,030
had the idea to just print
one, a dummy, try it out.

622
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:18,510
Maybe modify a couple of the dimensions,
and then go for the actual part.

623
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,150
But a tenth of an inch was fine.

624
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,830
If we wanted to be really a bit
more thorough, what we could do

625
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,730
is we could calculate the
axial stress under which it's

626
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,700
placed from the weight of a lens.

627
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,260
>> A great engineering practice and
one that is upheld universally

628
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,590
is to design in a safety factor.

629
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,287
So let's say this lens
weighs three pounds.

630
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:39,120
I just made that up.

631
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,210
But if we weighted this lens,
and it weighs three pounds,

632
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,630
and you design your part to be
able to sustain three pounds,

633
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,940
but buckle after that, then
that's not really great practice

634
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,752
because there's going to be impulse
when you pick the camera up.

635
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,710
This will experience
greater than three pounds.

636
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,560
So you always want to
design your part for greater

637
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,320
than it will actually ever experience.

638
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,490
So typically, a safety factor of
two is fine for something like this.

639
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,000
But honestly, at a 1/10
of an inch wall thickness,

640
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,260
this probably has a
safety factor of like 15.

641
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,030
So right now, we're just
going off of instinct.

642
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,470
>> But if we were to do it
out of a material that's

643
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,320
a little bit easier to work
with, like aluminum or steel,

644
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,650
we could calculate the
stress and then compare that

645
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,277
to that material's yield
stress or ultimate stress.

646
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:28,110
AUDIENCE: Does this kind of plastic
such numbers associated with it?

647
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,600
Or is it [INAUDIBLE]?

648
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
ANSEL DUFF: No, it does.

649
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,390
So what we're using
out of our 3D printer

650
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,500
is PLA filament, which
is like a bioplastic.

651
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,550
And although I haven't
personally looked these up,

652
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,910
I know there are figures available
for yield stress and yield

653
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,790
sheer associated with this plastic.

654
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,040
We did not design for that because
it's actually hollowed out.

655
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,260
The MakerBot software processes
honeycomb, and it adds it in.

656
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,660
So it's not completely solid.

657
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,240
So those calculations would be faulty.

658
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,350
They would not be accurate, unless
we made this completely solid.

659
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,330
But it would take days
to print in that case.

660
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,850
So just in the interest of time, we
let the hollowing happen and test.

661
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,040
>> So now, we're just
going to tell SolidWorks

662
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,460
that these are the same distance away.

663
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,120
So there are two ways of doing this.

664
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,310
One way is to go to Smart Dimension
and dimension both of these lines

665
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,950
and to make them the same number.

666
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,450
That's not a great practice
because down the road,

667
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,000
if we find that this webbing is
too thin, we would have to go

668
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,450
and change eight dimensions just
for one fundamental property, right?

669
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,200
>> If we said that these webs are
buckling, let's double their thickness,

670
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,810
you don't want to have to go
in and modify eight dimensions.

671
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,240
It's like when you're
writing code, if you're

672
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,950
going to be using the
same number over and over

673
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,710
and over again, you define a constant
at the beginning of the file,

674
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,120
and then use that constant throughout.

675
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,580
And then, when it's time to change it,
you only have to change one number.

676
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,030
It's the same principle here.

677
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,210
So our constant is adding relations.

678
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,990
>> So we'll dimension it one time.

679
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:09,450
So we'll go Smart
Dimension, we can go 0.05.

680
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,770
And I'm making this half
of our 100 thou thickness

681
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,595
because there'll be two sides to it.

682
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:22,100
So we define it once, and then we add
center lines to make the relations.

683
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,480
So we go here.

684
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,360
We make two.

685
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,970
And then, we're just going
to make these equal length.

686
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,505
The dimension will be taken care of.

687
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:33,652
So highlight both, make them
equal, and now this line is black.

688
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:34,610
So we'll do that again.

689
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,250

690
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,230
Just going to go a little bit faster.

691
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:44,810
>> You'll notice that when I'm hovering the
mouse over the line, it becomes orange.

692
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,250
And then, I click.

693
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,630
You can be sure that the line is--
these two lines are coincident.

694
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,370
They meet at this end point
because it was highlighted orange

695
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,170
when we selected it.

696
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:00,740
So make these parallel,
likewise for this piece.

697
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,680
We're going to do the same thing with
our center lines, zoom in a little bit.

698
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:12,330

699
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,230
Just select these.

700
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,530
Selected a face there,
that's why it turned blue.

701
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,410
>> And I'm going to go back to the
original and make them all equal.

702
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,390
So we dictated the length of this
with this dimension, 0.05 inches.

703
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,695
And because we made these all equals,
SolidWorks just figured the rest out.

704
00:33:28,695 --> 00:33:33,695

705
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:36,260
I'm trying to think.

706
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,340
>> One option is we could
take all these, in fact,

707
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,840
we probably didn't even need this x.

708
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,881
And we could mirror them.

709
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:43,270
You could manually redraw them.

710
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,230
But it's a bit redundant because
the features are the same.

711
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,390
So what we will do
is-- actually won't be

712
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,720
able to mirror it because
these are not mirror images.

713
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,030

714
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,720
Whoops.

715
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,750
>> So what I was thinking is this
bulges out, and this bulges in.

716
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,910
So this is concave and this is convex.

717
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,720
If they were both
convex or both concave,

718
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,679
you could highlight all of these,
mirror them about the center line,

719
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,670
and then everything
would be taken care of.

720
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,159
But if we were to do
that, this line would

721
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,451
translate to being a
convex line down here.

722
00:34:16,451 --> 00:34:17,659
But we need it to be concave.

723
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,960
So that's no good.

724
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,710
We'll just draw it in by hand.

725
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,400
Adding in the cross of our center line.

726
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,199
Great.

727
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,510
Go back, select actual
line, can zoom in.

728
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,420
>> In SolidWorks, you can just
zoom by scrolling on your mouse.

729
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,489
And then, the middle click, so if
you have a mouse with a jog wheel,

730
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,800
if you hold down that
jog wheel, that will

731
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,659
allow you to change
your view orientation.

732
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,250
Some mice, like mine here, they
do not come with jog wheels.

733
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,980
It's a touch pad on top effectively.

734
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:53,060
So I've configured my mouse using
a program called Magic Press, which

735
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,020
is a free Mac preference
program to be able to just hold

736
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,330
two fingers down onto it and
move the part around for view.

737
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,056
So if you're using a Mac and running
a Windows virtual machine like I am,

738
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:08,580
I've seen a lot of people
with the same Magic Mouse,

739
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,550
I would recommend Magic Press.

740
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,040
It's free.

741
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,300
So you can make these parallel.

742
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,590
Oops.

743
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,970
Not what I want.

744
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,300
>> So sometimes, when you're
working at an obscure angle,

745
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,750
it can be kind of hard
to see the relation.

746
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,950
So we're just going to select this
little box here and then go back

747
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,700
to the normal.

748
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,700
And that'll make everything
a lot easier to look at.

749
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,747
So sometimes, the part
will be really far away.

750
00:35:33,747 --> 00:35:36,330
If you want to zoom in and have
it fit your screen if you just

751
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:38,944
hit F on your keyboard, that zooms in.

752
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:41,610
You can see it's kind of far away
because these center lines are

753
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,220
a bit longer than they need to be.

754
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:52,340
But if we just shorten these down a
bit, like so, and then hit F again,

755
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,392
now zoom in.

756
00:35:54,392 --> 00:35:55,730
So we make these parallel.

757
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:00,260

758
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,970
Awesome.

759
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,350
Do likewise here.

760
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:08,590
>> And then, we'll add in those
little support structures,

761
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:14,422
these center lines to dictate the
depth or the thickness of these lines.

762
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,380
You'll notice that when
I'm drawing, SolidWorks

763
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,120
creates that yellow dashed line.

764
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,030
That dashed line is normal
or orthogonal to the line

765
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,140
that this line that
we're drawing started on.

766
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,190
So if you follow that
dashed yellow line,

767
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,141
you can be sure that it
is in fact orthogonal.

768
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:31,080
We'll do it again.

769
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,980

770
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,650
>> Just for good measure,
we can double check

771
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,500
once we're done sketching
just by selecting a line,

772
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,800
and all the relations come up
here, perpendicular, awesome.

773
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,960
We'll make these all equal length.

774
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,760
Select them all.

775
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,676
Then, we're going to go back to the
original line that we dimensioned.

776
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:56,850
Select that, hit equal,
and then we zoom out.

777
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,980
These lines are all black.

778
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,890
Cool.

779
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:02,170
>> So we are ready to exit our
sketch and cut out these webs.

780
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,017
So we hit Exit Sketch notice that
the sketch is still highlighted here

781
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:07,850
because we're going to
do something with it.

782
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,470
Now, if I go to Features and I hit
Extrude Cut, which is now an option,

783
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,220
it's going to freak
out because it doesn't

784
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,340
know which sketch we're
going to use as the base.

785
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,540
So leave that.

786
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,370
We can hide this.

787
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,180
We don't have any need for it.

788
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,106
>> So we select the sketch
that we just made.

789
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:23,980
We can even label it.

790
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,670
We'll call it webbing,
or just web sketch.

791
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:31,020
Now that it's highlighted,
we can extrude

792
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,450
it, which is-- we don't
want to create material.

793
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,130
We want to cut material away.

794
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,040
So we'll go and we'll
use an extruded cut.

795
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,140
So now, there are a lot of
geometries happening in our sketch.

796
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,320
>> We need to tell SolidWorks which pieces,
which triangles and rectangles we

797
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,370
want to cut.

798
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:51,250
So if we go down here and we hit
Selected Contours and highlight

799
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,000
this box, it becomes blue.

800
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,200
And then, you can click
on different parts.

801
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,360
I'll just click on
everything we want gone.

802
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,120
And it will cut everything
away that is highlighted.

803
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,840
So there's the option now of
how deep do we want to cut.

804
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,052
We could cut partially.

805
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:08,760
We don't have to cut
all the way through.

806
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,470
We could do like 0.751 divided by 2.

807
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,745
This will cut halfway through.

808
00:38:16,745 --> 00:38:18,294
You can see in the preview there.

809
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:19,460
But that's not what we want.

810
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,950
We want to go all the way through.

811
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:23,830
>> So this little dialogue
box, we just click.

812
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,520
And select Up To Next, and
that'll cut all the way through.

813
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,272
Hit the green arrow.

814
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:31,730
And our sketch is still
highlighted, but if you click away,

815
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,480
now we have the webbing done.

816
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,270
So you'll notice if you look
kind of closely at this part

817
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,380
that the corners are
rounded off internally.

818
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,290
That's a feature called a fillet.

819
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,480
What a fillet does is it eliminates
what are called stress concentrations.

820
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,210
If you have really sharp points
at any place in your part,

821
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,210
whether it's made of some composite
or steel or aluminum or what have you,

822
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,600
really sharp points can
cause stress concentrations

823
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,220
when they're subjected to loads.

824
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,190
>> So if we were to really
push this part, it

825
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,860
would likely break at one
of these really sharp nodes.

826
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,630
So to combat that, we
use what are called

827
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,560
fillets, which is just really
gentle rounding in there.

828
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,500
So we go to this fillet feature.

829
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,970
We have a dialogue box.

830
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,390
I find it helpful to select
this full preview option.

831
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,470
And all we have to do is just click on
a line, and it creates a fillet for us.

832
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,131
So it defaulted to having the
radius be a tenth of an inch.

833
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,130
That's a little extreme.

834
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,220
So we'll do maybe 20 thou.

835
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,320
That's a little small.

836
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,769
Split the difference, say.

837
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:30,810
Not split the difference.

838
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,670
Let's do 50 thou.

839
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,740
That looks good.

840
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,420
So now, we're just going to
select all these other fillets.

841
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:45,880

842
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,760
Kind of just fly through this.

843
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,300

844
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,330
>> So once we complete the part,
I'll go back and show you

845
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,655
how painless it is to
modify a dimension.

846
00:40:02,655 --> 00:40:05,280
Like I said, it's helpful to
print out kind of a dummy version,

847
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,950
test it, see if it's strong enough.

848
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:11,970
Maybe you want to make the letters
larger or something of the like.

849
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,685
Oops, I selected a face accidentally.

850
00:40:13,685 --> 00:40:16,090
We don't want that.

851
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,522
Select this line, one more time.

852
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:19,480
That was the wrong one.

853
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,490
If it's hard for you
to deselect that line,

854
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,740
you can go over to the box here that's
listing everything, right click,

855
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,630
and then say delete.

856
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,890
Do not say Clear Selection
because that'll delete every line,

857
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,070
unless that's what you want to do.

858
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,420
Cool, just one more to god.

859
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,745
Oh, missed a couple at the top.

860
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:43,390

861
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,916
All right.

862
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:49,065
>> AUDIENCE: There's more up top, the
left triangle at the top and bottom.

863
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:52,280
>> ANSEL DUFF: Oh, god.

864
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,050
That is code red.

865
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,000
All right, now we have our fillets.

866
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,105
Now, it looks a little weird.

867
00:40:58,105 --> 00:41:00,230
They look a little bit
bigger than they need to be.

868
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:06,490
So if we want to adjust that,
let's just label this web fillet.

869
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:11,940
We can right click on this, and this
box pops up, and we hit Edit Feature.

870
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,720
And we just have to change one number.

871
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,020
Let's do maybe say 30 thou.

872
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
And they become smaller
and get the green arrow.

873
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,390
So if we wanted to change all those
features, there were a lot of them,

874
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,910
you just had to change one number.

875
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,680
And that's really helpful for us.

876
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,880
>> Something that I've not yet done
is save my part, not a bad idea

877
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,880
during the middle of it.

878
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,250
We'll just hit Save As.

879
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:40,260
We'll call it lens support 2,
since I've already made one.

880
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,270
And now, we want to just add in
letters, and then we're ready to go.

881
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:51,290
>> So to do that, we're going to make
ourselves normal to this plane again.

882
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:54,226
Now that it's selected, we
can go and sketch on it.

883
00:41:54,226 --> 00:41:55,850
And now, we're going to add letters in.

884
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,900
So part is actually upside down.

885
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,577
This probably wasn't a
good face to sketch on.

886
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:01,910
I'm going to sketch on this one.

887
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,960

888
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,400
So sketch, SolidWorks
has a letters feature.

889
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,620
But we need to orient
the letters in space.

890
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,171
And that's done, again
by making a center line.

891
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,420
In case you haven't noticed,
that's kind of the theme,

892
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,320
to make center lines for
anything you might need it for.

893
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,500
>> So for now, let's just add a
Smart Dimension from this line.

894
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,365
We'll say 0.01 inches.

895
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:31,240
I'm just eyeing that.

896
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,364
We're going to go back and
change that in a second.

897
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:35,870
But for now, it just
constrains this line in space.

898
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,370
Cool.

899
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,340
So now, we go to our
little font feature here.

900
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,700
It's that big A. So we just hit that.

901
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,520
That's A for Ansel.

902
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,000
So we type CS50.

903
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,570
Cool.

904
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,280
But we need to type the curve
that it's going to sit on.

905
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,880
So just click on that line, awesome.

906
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,330
Now, it's a little bit small here.

907
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:52,955
We want to make it a little bit larger.

908
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:54,960
So by default, it uses
the document font,

909
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,140
which is just defined in
some property list somewhere.

910
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,560
>> So we'll deselect that,
hit the font button,

911
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,710
and make this a little bit bigger.

912
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,840
I like to use this
units option because it

913
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,860
allows you to specify
the height in inches.

914
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,530
So I believe before we had made
this bridge 0.4 of an inch high,

915
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:17,070
so perhaps making the letters 3/10
of an inch tall, it'll look big.

916
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:18,660
That's pretty good.

917
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,439
Get the green arrow.

918
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:21,730
Make this a little bit smaller.

919
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:26,350
Let's halve it, so we
could go divide by 2.

920
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,687
And then, we'll just drag this dot
over to where I think it looks good.

921
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,512

922
00:43:32,512 --> 00:43:33,970
This is what we call a code orange.

923
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:35,553
The letters look a little bit too big.

924
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:37,660
So we're going to select them.

925
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,210
Go back to font, and let's make them
a quarter of an inch tall instead

926
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,742
of 3/10.

927
00:43:42,742 --> 00:43:47,130
Make them a little smaller,
move them into position.

928
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:47,630
Cool.

929
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,680
That looks pretty good.

930
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:58,470
We'll add a couple,
say, maybe bigger there.

931
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,760
>> SolidWorks is really interpretive
in this dimension box.

932
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,710
I had mentioned before that you
can use algebraic expressions.

933
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:07,040
But let's say we wanted
to be in millimeters.

934
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,140
We could say make this 5 millimeters,
and it will understand it.

935
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,600
So it'll automatically
convert it to inches.

936
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:20,070
So 5 millimeters, SolidWorks
tells us, is 0.19685039 inches.

937
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,700
So we'll go back to inches.

938
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,810
We'll say 0.07 inches.

939
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,730
My program is set up
to default to inches.

940
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,550
Everything we do in the
States is in inches.

941
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,560
But if you want to convert something,
there's no need to go to Google

942
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,390
and convert it because
SolidWorks will do it for you.

943
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:40,450
>> So this is just about centered.

944
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:44,490
If we really wanted to
be very, very precise,

945
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,510
we could measure the
width of the letters

946
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,840
and then center it against
the center line of the piece.

947
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,640
But that's kind of overkill here.

948
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,590
We'll just visually center it for now.

949
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,637
That looks almost there.

950
00:44:56,637 --> 00:44:57,970
We'll drag it over a little bit.

951
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,071
Sometimes, when you want to drag a
point by a very small amount, if you

952
00:45:01,071 --> 00:45:03,820
click on it and try to drag it a
little bit, it won't do anything.

953
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,260
So it's nice to move it far away, and
then come back close to where you were.

954
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,980
>> So hit F to bring us back out.

955
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,500
That looks pretty good.

956
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,900
We'll hit the green arrow.

957
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,690
Oh, wait a minute,
somebody said in the back.

958
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:18,100
The sketch is still blue.

959
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,770
So what are we going to do?

960
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,500
You'll notice that we have put
all the letters on this line.

961
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,795
But we haven't constrained them
in this dimension, left to right.

962
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:28,920
So the way we do that, this
is the point that we're

963
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,340
moving that dictates all letters,
we will fix this point in space.

964
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,352
And it will not move.

965
00:45:33,352 --> 00:45:35,060
So in our pane left
here-- in fact, we'll

966
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,439
deselect it-- we click on this point.

967
00:45:37,439 --> 00:45:39,980
This point dictates how the
letters are placed left to right,

968
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,010
like I had mentioned.

969
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,170
>> Select this point.

970
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,420
We see all the relations
over here, it's an empty box.

971
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,030
Nobody's home.

972
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,550
We hit fix.

973
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:47,400
Boom.

974
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,470
Oh my gosh.

975
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,190
What happened?

976
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,430
We have over defined the sketch.

977
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:55,250
So what this means is you
have multiple relations,

978
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:58,170
multiple dimensions
referring to the same entity.

979
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,235
So for example, if we had
made two lines parallel,

980
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:05,770
and then we added a dimension up top
to say that these lines are one inch

981
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:09,580
apart, then we add another dimension
at the bottom to say these line are two

982
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,520
inches apart, SolidWorks is going
to scream at us and give us the same

983
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,220
warning because you can't-- both
dimensions are referring to the same

984
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,290
entity.

985
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,020
Somehow, we have done that here.

986
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:24,290
>> So we can let's just rebuild it.

987
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:30,080
If at any point you want to rebuild
your sketch, or you change a dimension

988
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,330
and it didn't take, if you just hit this
little stoplight at the top here next

989
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:38,220
to the mouse, hit that,
SolidWorks will process it.

990
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,290
>> So this sketch has a little
yield flag next to it,

991
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,820
which means something's wrong.

992
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,410
So if we right click
and hit what's wrong,

993
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,190
we get a really unhelpful error message.

994
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,760
This sketch is over defined.

995
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,140
Consider deleting some-- so that
didn't tell us anything new.

996
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,450
We'll go back to sketching it.

997
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:57,960
And what happened?

998
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,330
>> Oh, we can't fix it in
space because it's already

999
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,630
defined to be 70 thou off of this line.

1000
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:13,625
So if we just delete this and refix
this point, it should be fixed in space.

1001
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:17,590

1002
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:23,770
So I know the letters are still
blue, but they are fixed in space.

1003
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,130
That I'm sure of.

1004
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,990
So we'll just move on.

1005
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:31,299
>> Now, we're going to cut these
letters into the material.

1006
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:33,590
If we wanted to, we could
cut them all the way through.

1007
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,960
But that might compromise
our part structurally.

1008
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,240
Not really, but it's not really great
practice to add an aesthetic feature

1009
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,290
or have an aesthetic feature
be structurally compromising.

1010
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:48,100
So we'll just cut them to be
maybe 10 thou deep or 100 thou,

1011
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,820
depending on how it looks.

1012
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,470
So we highlight our sketch.

1013
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,950
We'll label it because
we're good people.

1014
00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:00,630

1015
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,480
Computer froze for a second there.

1016
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,960
We'll call this letters sketch.

1017
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,890
And now, we will do an extruded cut.

1018
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:12,030
And we can change how deep they go.

1019
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,370
>> So right now, they are halfway through.

1020
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:16,700
That seems a little much.

1021
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,926
Let's do 200 thou.

1022
00:48:18,926 --> 00:48:23,390

1023
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:24,780
That looks pretty did.

1024
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,200
Hit the green arrow.

1025
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,890
And we are cooking, ready to go.

1026
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:34,510
So there are a lot of things that could
be the next step in our manufacture.

1027
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,290
We've completely designed a part.

1028
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:39,089
We can build it in varying ways.

1029
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:42,130
But what we first want to do is double
check that all of our measurements

1030
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:42,789
are right.

1031
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:44,580
It's very painless to
change the dimensions

1032
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,780
when you're in this build state.

1033
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,680
The part is completely
defined, and you just

1034
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,920
have to change maybe a number
here or a number there.

1035
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,040
But it's not that fun to build
it and then measure it or try

1036
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,284
to fit it and realize that
you messed something up.

1037
00:48:57,284 --> 00:49:00,200
We're not actually going to manufacture
this part right now because it

1038
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,783
takes a very, very long time to print.

1039
00:49:01,783 --> 00:49:05,730
But we would go back and
double measure everything.

1040
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,320
Measure twice, cut once, and
ensure that everything is correct.

1041
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,550
Let's hypothetically say that we
messed one of the measurements up.

1042
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,440
>> Let's say that the webs are too thin.

1043
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,430
They were buckling and we
want to make them thicker.

1044
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,200
It was kind of a pain to add in
all those dimensions before, all

1045
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,420
those relations, and make all
those lines of equal length.

1046
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,680
But now, if we want to
make the webs thicker,

1047
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,170
we can just go-- oops,
forgot to label this guy.

1048
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,600
We'll call this web cut.

1049
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,752
And this is letters cut.

1050
00:49:36,752 --> 00:49:39,350

1051
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:42,637
>> You'll notice that we have a
very neatly organized tree.

1052
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:45,720
In fact, if we're going to make this
part, we want to learn more about it,

1053
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,360
we need to define its material.

1054
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,870
So in this material box, we'll right
click, and then hit Edit Material.

1055
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:55,639
And SolidWorks gives us a very long
list of things that we can choose from.

1056
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:57,680
Let's say we're going to
make it out of aluminum.

1057
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,450
We'll do 6061 P6, that's
a tempering rating.

1058
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,822
We'll hit apply, close.

1059
00:50:03,822 --> 00:50:05,030
And now it's out of aluminum.

1060
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,850
It looks slightly brighter.

1061
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,260
Doesn't really do much for us.

1062
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,240
>> But it allows us to measure some
really interesting or cool aspects

1063
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,010
about this part specifically
being made out of aluminum.

1064
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:26,810
For example, if we go to the
Evaluate tab and hit Mass Properties,

1065
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,750
we see that the part
weights 0.09 pounds.

1066
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:32,750
Volume is not going to
change based on material.

1067
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:36,230
But weight is dictated by
which material you use.

1068
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,860
It's pretty cool.

1069
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,490
If we were to run a stress simulation,
the material that you choose

1070
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,310
will drastically alter the results.

1071
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,790
So that's pretty cool.

1072
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:48,270
>> If we wanted to make
it look different, we

1073
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,960
could pop out this tab here just by
hitting these double arrows and right

1074
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,790
click here and say appearance.

1075
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,490
And then, we can change to make
it blue, whatever you want.

1076
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,740
And then, in a final
render, if we wanted

1077
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:07,780
to make an actual render of this part,
we can choose its surface finish.

1078
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:09,960
So a lot of times,
you'll design your parts.

1079
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,660
They have this flat gray or
flat black aesthetic to them.

1080
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,700
But that just lightens
the load on SolidWorks

1081
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,860
so that you're not using
superfluous graphics power

1082
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:23,819
to render your part while
you're designing it.

1083
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,610
But if we did want to
do a render, we would

1084
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,230
have to define the surface finish.

1085
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,570
So let's just say that it's
polished aluminum for now.

1086
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,690
Notice that polished
aluminum pops up over here.

1087
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,940
Hit the green arrow.

1088
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,920
Cool, that took.

1089
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,280
And let's just change this
thickness of these webs.

1090
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,950
So all we have to do is go over to our
very neatly organized feature tree.

1091
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:46,560
And we see web cut.

1092
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,100
Expand that.

1093
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,680
Click on the web sketch.

1094
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,730
And then, we're just going
to change one number.

1095
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:56,760
>> So let's change it to instead
of being 50 thou on each side,

1096
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,740
so 100 thou total, let's
make it 80 thou total.

1097
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:02,240
Cool.

1098
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,851
You see the webs got
a little bit skinnier.

1099
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:05,350
Awesome.

1100
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:10,280
So we just changed all those
features just by one number.

1101
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,630
We changed the thickness.

1102
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:14,960
SolidWorks automatically recalculates
the fillets to make them fit.

1103
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,690
It changes all the geometries.

1104
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:21,100
And it works because we had
defined them to be all symmetrical

1105
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:24,100
and all defined off of one dimension.

1106
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,260
Like I said before, it's
analogous to defining

1107
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,945
a constant when you're writing code.

1108
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,510
>> AUDIENCE: Does it work if
you use any TrueType font,

1109
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:34,330
or are you limited to
what they [INAUDIBLE]?

1110
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,450
>> ANSEL DUFF: It works
off of your system font,

1111
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:43,080
so if we go back to our letters cut,
we had just gone with the default font.

1112
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,800
If we hit Edit Sketch, zoom in a little
bit, double click on the letters.

1113
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,995
If I can do that.

1114
00:52:51,995 --> 00:52:53,675
Take a second to trace them out.

1115
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:57,520

1116
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,050
And hit Font again.

1117
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,660
So we have a list of fonts here.

1118
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,090
And those are system fonts.

1119
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:04,720
If you want a specialty font,
and it's not on this list,

1120
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,010
you're going to need to
install it on your system.

1121
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,760
Just a little bit of Googling
around on how to do that on Windows.

1122
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,946
>> AUDIENCE: Also, does this thing know
what font size or changes are not

1123
00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:17,072
going to be [INAUDIBLE]?

1124
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:17,780
ANSEL DUFF: Yeah.

1125
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:24,110
So the question was how do we know
how thick or thin to make the fonts?

1126
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,310
How will the machine be able
to handle really thin features?

1127
00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:30,020
So of course, it's going to
vary from machine to machine.

1128
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,350
But just by reading the
spec sheet of our printer,

1129
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,580
we know that it has a
resolution of about 4 thou, four

1130
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:36,750
thousandths of an inch.

1131
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:41,300
So we want to make all the
features be well beyond that.

1132
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,200
So if you were to make a font that
was, say, 10 thou tall, that's

1133
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,260
like two sheets of paper, you
wouldn't be able to read it obviously.

1134
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,965
But just hypothetically,
if we wanted to make

1135
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:54,692
a font that was on the order
of the accuracy of the machine,

1136
00:53:54,692 --> 00:53:55,650
it would look horrible.

1137
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,270
So in our case, we know that
we're well beyond the accuracy

1138
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,220
of the machine in terms of the
ratio of the height of our font,

1139
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,650
or even the thickness of
any feature in the font

1140
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,530
to how accurate the machine
is capable of being.

1141
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,130
>> So we're in the clear here.

1142
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:13,600
But if hypothetically you
were using a machine that

1143
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,616
had an accuracy of maybe 250
thou, like a quarter of an inch,

1144
00:54:18,616 --> 00:54:20,740
then our font would look
really crappy because it's

1145
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:25,632
on the same order of how
accurate the machine is.

1146
00:54:25,632 --> 00:54:27,590
Another thing that we
need to pay attention to,

1147
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:32,540
and this is specific to 3D printing, is
how thick are our layers going to be.

1148
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:36,620
So I'll go over to MakerBot settings in
a little bit and we can play with this

1149
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,620
and talk more exhaustively
about it in a second.

1150
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,540
But the way that the
3D printer works is it

1151
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,590
extrudes filament in a
very fine thread almost.

1152
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:47,520
And if we make the thread or
the filament strand really,

1153
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,194
really large, then it's going
to look kind of blotchy and not

1154
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:52,610
that clear when we actually print.

1155
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,750
>> So again, just as a
rule of thumb, you want

1156
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,280
the size of your fonts
or all the features

1157
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:01,430
to be well beyond the
order of the thread size.

1158
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,400

1159
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,970
Yeah, so Exit Sketch.

1160
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:07,540
And it takes.

1161
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:12,480
If we were to change the font,
again, we can just hit this.

1162
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,110
And it will recalculate
it automatically for us.

1163
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,870
So we'll go font here.

1164
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,490
Choose Comic Sans.

1165
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:19,580
Great, looks atrocious.

1166
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,030
Hit the green arrow.

1167
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:22,040
Exit the sketch.

1168
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,581
And you'll notice that
it still looks so bad.

1169
00:55:25,581 --> 00:55:26,080
Wow.

1170
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:26,970
I can't even look at that.

1171
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,136
I'm just going to undo that.

1172
00:55:28,136 --> 00:55:30,090
Great.

1173
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:33,540
It will recalculate all the
curves and make the cut.

1174
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,830
>> So cool.

1175
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:35,740
We are good to go.

1176
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:37,272
So now, the next step.

1177
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:39,480
You're going to want to grab
a Snickers at this point

1178
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,960
because we've been working for a while.

1179
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,460
It's a good idea to take a breather.

1180
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,870
So what is the next step in manufacture?

1181
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:45,850
We could 3D print it.

1182
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,360
We could mill it.

1183
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,916
Those are the two popular options.

1184
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:50,790
If we were to mill it,
we would have to write

1185
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,800
what's called G code or CAM,
which is going to take a while,

1186
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,620
and we're not going to do.

1187
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:59,180
All that does is it tells a tool,
like an N mill, which is basically

1188
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:01,950
a fancy drill bit, where
to move around this piece

1189
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,560
to create all these features.

1190
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,650
Some things are impossible
to do with a mill.

1191
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:11,200
>> For example, if we go to our fillet
here, should be in web fillet,

1192
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,490
and we suppress that, which is done just
by hitting this little downward arrow,

1193
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:16,787
all the fillets go away.

1194
00:56:16,787 --> 00:56:18,370
We have all these really sharp points.

1195
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:21,230
This is a horrible design practice,
and you should never do this.

1196
00:56:21,230 --> 00:56:25,460
But hypothetically, if you did want to
design a really sharp corner in here,

1197
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:30,140
you could not create that corner
with an N mill of finite diameter.

1198
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:34,330
You cannot have-- you can
conceptualize it as a fancy drill bit.

1199
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,220
You can't have a drill
bit moving around and just

1200
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:41,750
bumping off the bottom of that corner
node and leaving a very hard corner.

1201
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,180
That's just impossible.

1202
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,780
>> So those are things to be aware of.

1203
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,370
And when you create CAM, those
will all become apparent.

1204
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:51,530
But just things to be aware of.

1205
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,590
Luckily, the 3D printer
is really cool because it

1206
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,110
can create really obscure geometries
and really obscure fixtures.

1207
00:56:57,110 --> 00:57:01,630
So we're in the clear here, but it's
nice to think about those things.

1208
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:06,500
So one last thing we want to
add in is a hole on the bottom.

1209
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:10,050
Like I mentioned before, there's
a mounting hole in our piece here.

1210
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,730
And that's how we bolt it in.

1211
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,940
>> When I made the version zero,
I did not CAD in that hole.

1212
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:18,170
I just went and took a Sharpie
and held it up and marked it

1213
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,140
and drilled it by hand.

1214
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,098
That was kind of a pain, and not
really excited about doing that again,

1215
00:57:22,098 --> 00:57:23,430
so we'll just CAD it in.

1216
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:29,280
So here's a really exciting time because
we need to add in a reference plane

1217
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,250
because, shock, you cannot
sketch on a curved face.

1218
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,500
Something that you cannot do.

1219
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,380
This face is curved.

1220
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,280
We had provided it with a radius before.

1221
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,690
I'm going to move this
dimension out of the way.

1222
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,710
You cannot sketch on it.

1223
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:44,810
>> If we select it and try
to hit sketch, oh my gosh,

1224
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,810
cannot sketch on a non-planar face.

1225
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:49,870
Wow, good thing your buddy
Ansel told you about that.

1226
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,240
And he also taught you how
to create a reference plane.

1227
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,090
So we select this.

1228
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:59,430
We hit Reference Geometry, Plane.

1229
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:02,410
Now, we have a plane that
is tangent to our face.

1230
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,805
Or maybe we don't.

1231
00:58:04,805 --> 00:58:06,162
That's not good.

1232
00:58:06,162 --> 00:58:08,960

1233
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,190
I don't know why it's doing that.

1234
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:17,540

1235
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:23,040
>> So we need to-- if we were to just
select this face and create tangency,

1236
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:26,790
the plane could be at
infinitely many angles

1237
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:30,140
while still being tangent to that face.

1238
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,240
So we need to constrain it
again using a second plane.

1239
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,420
So I had selected the
side of our face here.

1240
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,050
And SolidWorks defaulted
to perpendicularity.

1241
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:44,620
But you could select that yourself,
and it would give the same result.

1242
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:48,220
>> So all we've done is
just define this plane

1243
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:51,530
that is tangent to our
bottom face here but then

1244
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,670
orthogonal to the side of the part.

1245
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:56,000
So when we create our
hole, our hole is going

1246
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,165
to extrude normal to the
plane, which is going

1247
00:58:58,165 --> 00:58:59,790
to be parallel to the side of the part.

1248
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,740
That's what we want.

1249
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,260
If we were to create tangency
on a different plane,

1250
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:09,230
then perhaps the hole would be at
an angle, and nothing would line up.

1251
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:12,000
So this is a nice,
simple example for us.

1252
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,960
So we just hit normal to, now we're
normal to the bottom of the part,

1253
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,850
and now we can go through the
same procedure of CADing up a hole

1254
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,170
and extruding it.

1255
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:26,530
>> So again, we'll just
create a circle here.

1256
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,480
A better idea would be-- we're
not technically sketching

1257
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,804
right now, which is why
SolidWorks just yelled at us.

1258
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:36,470
It's kind of like your mom, yelling
at you to clean up the room.

1259
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:39,520
So let's sketch here,
add in some center lines.

1260
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,454

1261
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:45,370
I don't know why it
doesn't want me to sketch.

1262
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,240
Oh, we forgot to select the plane
that we're going to sketch on.

1263
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:56,060
So let's rename our plane bottom plane,
hit Sketch, make a center line here.

1264
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,210
Something that's really cool is
even though we're normal to this

1265
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:02,420
and we haven't unlocked
or unhidden any sketches,

1266
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,260
SolidWorks will still allow us to
create a sketch that is making relations

1267
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,210
to features of the part that
we did not tell it to do.

1268
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,520
>> So you'll notice, when I hold
the pencil over the corner

1269
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:16,330
here, that little orange bubble pops up.

1270
01:00:16,330 --> 01:00:19,310
We can create a relation
to the corner of the part.

1271
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:22,300
But we didn't tell SolidWorks
that we want it to do that.

1272
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:24,580
So I think that's super cool.

1273
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,180
So we'll just make a
center line up top here.

1274
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,528
Make another one down the center.

1275
01:00:29,528 --> 01:00:33,300

1276
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:33,800
Uh-oh.

1277
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,480

1278
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,300
I did not do it off the midpoint.

1279
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,360
That is offensive.

1280
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:44,170
All right, go down the middle here.

1281
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,852

1282
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:47,851
>> It's vertical.

1283
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:48,350
Cool.

1284
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,580
It's all black, so we're good to go.

1285
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,470
We'll make a circle.

1286
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:56,350
And dimension its diameter.

1287
01:00:56,350 --> 01:01:02,577
I'm just going to arbitrarily say
0.10 inches, a tenth of an inch.

1288
01:01:02,577 --> 01:01:05,660
Everything's bolted together, so we
don't have anything to measure off of.

1289
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:11,640
But we would, if this were threaded,
you could stick several different screws

1290
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,190
in there and then just
find which matched.

1291
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:16,200
But it's not just a clearance hole.

1292
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,430
So there are two
different types of holes,

1293
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:22,180
threaded or tapped holes, that will
accept threads, accept a screw.

1294
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,080
And those will not be able to move.

1295
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,680
That's how you bolt things together.

1296
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,900
Or there are clearance
holes, which are larger

1297
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,020
than the biggest
diameter of the threads.

1298
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,620
>> And that allows threads to
just pass right on through.

1299
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:36,020
So the way our fixture
works here is that we

1300
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,400
have a clearance hole in the metal.

1301
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,980
And then, another
clearance hole in the part.

1302
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,360
And then, just a nut on top.

1303
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,700
You could go in and measure with
calipers using the interior prongs here

1304
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,020
what the diameter is.

1305
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,830
But everything's bolted together,
so we're not going to do that.

1306
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:55,460
We'll just set it at 1/10
of an inch arbitrarily.

1307
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,090
Then, you would measure this height.

1308
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:02,500
I'll just set it at 0.250.

1309
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,880
>> Again, this is arbitrary.

1310
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:07,640
But you would ideally measure
that and be good to go.

1311
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,910
So hit the green arrow.

1312
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:10,270
Exit the sketch.

1313
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:11,220
Sketch is done.

1314
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,620
Now, we're going to make it into
a feature by hitting extrude cut.

1315
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:18,880
We want it to only go through the
first layer, so we hit Up To Next.

1316
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,300
Hit the green arrow.

1317
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:20,989
Now cool.

1318
01:02:20,989 --> 01:02:24,030
So another cool thing, I'm just going
to hide this plane because it's not

1319
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:25,363
doing anything for us right now.

1320
01:02:25,363 --> 01:02:28,300

1321
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,390
>> So another cool thing is that
we did not tell SolidWorks

1322
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,980
how deep we wanted that hole to be.

1323
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,460
We just said Up To Next, which means
that there are many, many layers here.

1324
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,100
There's one, two, three, four, five
layers that it could have cut through.

1325
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:44,690
But just by saying Up To Next, it knew
to only cut through the first one.

1326
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:49,510
If we were to say Through
All, hit the green arrow,

1327
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:50,810
it sketches through everything.

1328
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,430
You can see daylight on
the other side of it.

1329
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:54,580
That's not what we want.

1330
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,080
So Up To Next.

1331
01:02:56,080 --> 01:03:00,230
There are a lot of options here,
but Up To Next is what we want.

1332
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:00,730
Cool.

1333
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:04,550
So now our part is completely
done, and it is time to machine it.

1334
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:08,070
So like I said, we're going
to step through doing this

1335
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:10,600
with MakerBot 3D printer.

1336
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,980
But you can do it with anything.

1337
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:14,100
So we'll go here.

1338
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:17,640
We're going to save our
part as a .stl file.

1339
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,940
So we do Save As, lend
support to, and select .stl.

1340
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,650
Hit Save.

1341
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:27,300
I'm actually going to save
this in my Downloads folder.

1342
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,394
Hit Save.

1343
01:03:28,394 --> 01:03:29,310
SolidWorks prompts us.

1344
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:30,700
Do you want this to be an STL?

1345
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,440
Hit Yes.

1346
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:31,940
Cool.

1347
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:35,900
And now, we are ready to fire up
to MakerBot desktop application.

1348
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,028
>> So let's do that.

1349
01:03:38,028 --> 01:03:41,840

1350
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,890
All right, ready to go.

1351
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,175
So at this point, I always like
to view the plate from the top.

1352
01:03:48,175 --> 01:03:49,930
It's nice to be on top.

1353
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,640
So we'll just go here.

1354
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,162
Add file.

1355
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,620
We're going to go to our downloads.

1356
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:58,520
I think we called it lens support 2.

1357
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,500
So here we go.

1358
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,000
Open it up.

1359
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:05,965
It is on our platform.

1360
01:04:05,965 --> 01:04:09,500

1361
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:13,095
>> So this is kind of an impractical
way for us to print the part.

1362
01:04:13,095 --> 01:04:16,230
If we zoom in a little
bit here, you'll notice

1363
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:19,360
that the arc is touching the base.

1364
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:22,470
So the 3D printer is going to try
to figure out a way to print this.

1365
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:24,950
But it's going to freak out
unless you add supports to it.

1366
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,590
But that's kind of a headache.

1367
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:31,020
>> The easy way to do it
is just to select turn.

1368
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,930
The part is selected because
it's highlighted in yellow.

1369
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:41,370
Turn, and then we're going
to want to go-- whoops.

1370
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:43,320
We're just going to
push it back 90 degrees.

1371
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,560
Hit Lay Flat.

1372
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,830
Lay Flat ensures that its
bottom face is touching

1373
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,460
the bottom face of the build plate.

1374
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:50,780
And we're good to go.

1375
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:54,630
So our maker bot is
not right now connected

1376
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,190
to the network for some reason.

1377
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:57,520
But that's OK.

1378
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,584
We can just hit Export Print File.

1379
01:04:59,584 --> 01:05:00,875
It'll take a second to process.

1380
01:05:00,875 --> 01:05:03,580

1381
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,540
>> And you can put it on
a flash drive and then

1382
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,150
plug that flash drive into the printer.

1383
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:13,530
So it's a good idea sometimes to
mess around with the settings.

1384
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,310
When you first open this box up,
it'll say-- it has a couple presets.

1385
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:19,300
Do you want low resolution,
high resolution?

1386
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:22,390
But we can actually change these
at a much more granular level.

1387
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:26,550
So I'll just walk through a couple of
these parameters and what they mean.

1388
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:32,040
>> Infill is percent of the volume of
the part is being actually printed.

1389
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,510
So if infill were at 100%,
everything would be printed.

1390
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:39,200
It wouldn't do any null hollow
features, no honeycombing.

1391
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,030
It would print a completely solid part.

1392
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,820
It would take an eternity.

1393
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,430
So we will set it as 15% here.

1394
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:49,070
I think the default that
MakerBot comes with is like 10%.

1395
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,990
But 15% is fine.

1396
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:54,690
If you print the part and then try
it out and it buckles or breaks

1397
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,440
or it seems kind of weak, then
you can just bump that number up

1398
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,000
and it'll be a lot stronger.

1399
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,560
The plastic filament itself
is actually pretty strong,

1400
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,610
so just bump that number up.

1401
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,910
It'll make it a bit stronger.

1402
01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:07,450
>> Number of shells is
how many shells on top

1403
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,660
of the honeycomb, how many layers
on top of the honeycomb it prints.

1404
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:13,260
I set it to five to give
it a nice finish quality.

1405
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,950
And then, layer height is the diameter
of the thread that is being extruded.

1406
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:21,970
So right now, 0.2 millimeters,
a fifth of a millimeter

1407
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,100
is what it's printing at.

1408
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:28,170
But I think it goes all the way down
to, wow, a hundredth of a millimeter.

1409
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:28,870
That is tiny.

1410
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:35,550
So that will take-- if we set this
to 100% infill with five shells

1411
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:40,465
at 0.01 millimeter layer height, hit
Save Settings, and then Export Print

1412
01:06:40,465 --> 01:06:44,130
File, you'll see the expected
time is going to be huge.

1413
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:47,990
We'll just let it process because I'm
curious to see how large it would be.

1414
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:54,510
>> I think this part using 15% infill,
0.2 millimeter layer, and five shells

1415
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,115
took about two hours to print.

1416
01:06:56,115 --> 01:06:58,240
But you can see it's even
taking a really long time

1417
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:04,250
to prepare and to create the
actual MakerBot file for it.

1418
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:07,840
>> So something that's MakerBot about
specific is that from this desktop

1419
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,510
application, it will export
in a .makerbot file format.

1420
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:14,000
That is only file format
that the machine will accept.

1421
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,170
If you try to give it an STL, it
will freak out, maybe explode.

1422
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:21,890
So always a good idea to export
in a .makerbot file format.

1423
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:23,820
So that's going to process.

1424
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:30,270
>> In the meantime, let's just hop back to
SolidWorks here and look at our part.

1425
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:33,580
So this was kind of a
nice example of a part

1426
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:37,770
because it allows you to design for
something that already exists, right?

1427
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:41,210
We had to measure all the
supports that already exist.

1428
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:43,230
In reality, there are a
lot more considerations

1429
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:46,120
that you need to take into
account for when designing a part.

1430
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:51,270
For example, I won't do an in depth
demo of this little phone dock,

1431
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:53,830
but there were a couple
more considerations

1432
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,330
that we needed to take into account.

1433
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,329
>> So you'll notice that
when the phone is sitting,

1434
01:07:57,329 --> 01:07:59,340
and I'll try to give
you a side angle there.

1435
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,170
When the phone is
sitting in the dock, it

1436
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,990
is kind of raked back by a little bit.

1437
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:05,540
I think I set that at 15 degrees.

1438
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:06,900
That's somewhat arbitrary.

1439
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:11,100
But as it's raked back, the
center of gravity of the phone

1440
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,760
is going to be displaced
from its base meaning that,

1441
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,260
if when designing the part we had just
cut it off and not had this back panel,

1442
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:22,370
but it was only this much,
then when we put the phone in,

1443
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,850
it would've just toppled over.

1444
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,880
>> That's because the center
of gravity of the whole part

1445
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,490
of the phone, the heavy part,
would extend proud of the base.

1446
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:33,090
And it will create a tipping
moment, and it'll fall over.

1447
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:38,550
So a way to combat that in design
is to just make a quick mock up

1448
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:41,580
of your phone, which will
take like two seconds.

1449
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,310
We'll just make a new part.

1450
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,050
Make the fastest mock up of an iPhone.

1451
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:50,170
So let's make a rectangle
on the top plane.

1452
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:55,490
Here, create, define these.

1453
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:57,364
Just going to measure
quickly with calipers.

1454
01:08:57,364 --> 01:09:00,370

1455
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:10,010
The width is 2.308.

1456
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:24,260
And then, the height is 4.880.

1457
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:29,760
And then, the depth, this is the number
that everybody cares about in tech,

1458
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,300
0.30.

1459
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:37,870
I have a screen protector on it, 0.303.

1460
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:39,130
>> Cool.

1461
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:39,802
Extrude it.

1462
01:09:39,802 --> 01:09:43,910

1463
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:48,830
And then, I'll add some fillets.

1464
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,798
It's a little bit trickier
to measure the fill diameter.

1465
01:09:51,798 --> 01:09:54,214
You can use a gauge, but I
don't have one on me right now.

1466
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:59,318

1467
01:09:59,318 --> 01:10:01,890
We'll just eye it, and that'll be fine.

1468
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:10,050

1469
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,180
That looks about right, just visually.

1470
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,990
This is like a dummy phone that
we just made in like a minute.

1471
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:22,280
So we'll save this as iPhone dummy.

1472
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:28,300

1473
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:32,190
And now, we can create an
assembly with our dock and measure

1474
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:35,400
how far the middle of our
phone is from the base.

1475
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,426
So I had mentioned before that we
create parts, assemblies, and drawings.

1476
01:10:39,426 --> 01:10:41,300
Drawings are not really
something that you'll

1477
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,310
mess with unless you're designing
parts that will be made out

1478
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:47,120
of house at a machine
shop or what have you.

1479
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:50,530
And it's a little bit more involved
to properly dimension a drawing

1480
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:54,020
and make sure that every
dimension is clear.

1481
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:57,190
And you also have to add tolerances,
and that gets a little bit more

1482
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,350
involved, so we'll just
kind of gloss over that.

1483
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:02,490
But let's say we want to make an
assembly with the phone dock that I've

1484
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:04,900
already designed and our dummy phone.

1485
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,930
>> So we've already saved this.

1486
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,590
Let's go up to File.

1487
01:11:08,590 --> 01:11:10,880
Make Assembly From Part.

1488
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,090
And then, we're going to
hit Add and iPhone dummy.

1489
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:17,510
Also, nice to just select
this graphics preview.

1490
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:20,020
That'll show you the actual part itself.

1491
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:27,520
And then, insert another component will
browse for the iPhone dock, CS50 dock.

1492
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,880
Cool.

1493
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,430
So now, it's a nice sanity
check just to double check

1494
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,210
that the phone will actually fit
in the dock that we've designed

1495
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:37,180
and how it will look.

1496
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:40,670
So let's make this face coincident
with the bottom of this face.

1497
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:44,890
And these relations are all handled
through what are called mates

1498
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:47,400
in assemblies wherein
you have two parts,

1499
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:52,090
and you need to join them by a
list of defined joining features.

1500
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:58,130
>> So for example, we need to put our
phone which is being currently blown up,

1501
01:11:58,130 --> 01:11:59,220
call you later!

1502
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:02,350
In a dock, and we need to say
that the bottom face of our phone

1503
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:06,190
is coincident with the inside
bottom face of the dock.

1504
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:08,230
And then, this will be centered inside.

1505
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:12,180
We've given a little bit of a tolerance
so that it's not a super tight fit.

1506
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:14,440
And that will completely define it.

1507
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:16,640
We'll make these two coincident.

1508
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:23,020
Select mate up here, and it defaults
to coincident, but it's inverted.

1509
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:27,210
So if we just hit this little
button down here, it'll flip it.

1510
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:30,920
We hit the green arrow.

1511
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,560
So looking good.

1512
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,617
I've actually forgotten what the
tolerance was on the spacing.

1513
01:12:37,617 --> 01:12:39,700
Like I said, I gave it a
little bit of extra space

1514
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,750
because it doesn't really
want to be a tight fit.

1515
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,340
So what we can do is measure
the difference between them

1516
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:45,590
and then split the difference.

1517
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,210
>> So we can use the measure
tool in SolidWorks.

1518
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:50,502
We go up here to evaluate, measure.

1519
01:12:50,502 --> 01:12:52,710
Little tape measure comes
up and that annoying window

1520
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,700
in the middle of your part.

1521
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:58,580
And we're going to select these two
faces, they're highlighted in green.

1522
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:01,960
And their distance is 2.36 inches.

1523
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,070
So I think we said 2.36.

1524
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:06,190
We'll remember that.

1525
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:09,680
This was 2.308.

1526
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:13,390
So we'll just split that
difference with space.

1527
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:13,890
Whoa.

1528
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:16,830
So we got a mate.

1529
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,570
Select these two faces.

1530
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,690
Coincident.

1531
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:22,040
Whoa, gotta add a little
bit of space in there.

1532
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,620
So it was, I think, 2.36.

1533
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:31,700
We'll make this in parentheses to be
clearer, minus 2.308 divided by 2.

1534
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,630
That's splitting the
difference for space.

1535
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:34,522
Good to go.

1536
01:13:34,522 --> 01:13:36,730
But if we eye it, it looks
like the phone is actually

1537
01:13:36,730 --> 01:13:39,210
extended in this
direction beyond the dock.

1538
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,945
So we just need to flip it.

1539
01:13:40,945 --> 01:13:42,420
It made very little difference.

1540
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,800
Can't really see all that well.

1541
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,960
Hit the green arrow.

1542
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,860
And then finally, we'll make this back
face coincident to the back there.

1543
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:54,480
>> Realistically, there's also a
tolerance for, you can see there,

1544
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,560
space in the front.

1545
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,144
We could split that difference.

1546
01:13:57,144 --> 01:13:59,310
But it's just the same
procedure, so it's redundant.

1547
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:02,920
Cool, so let's look at it from the side.

1548
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,220
Mate is still selected there.

1549
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:08,170

1550
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:11,480
>> If we were to draw a line
normal to this in the middle,

1551
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,950
you'll actually see that the
center of gravity of the phone

1552
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,670
is somewhere in this region.

1553
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,150
It's in the middle of the base.

1554
01:14:18,150 --> 01:14:22,300
We purposefully extended the base well
beyond where the center of gravity

1555
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,430
falls such that it will be able
to sustain a tipping moment,

1556
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:27,800
like when you place
your phone in the dock.

1557
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,970
You don't have to do it super gently.

1558
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:30,980
You can just put it in.

1559
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,280
It doesn't fall over.

1560
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,930
>> If the distance between where the
center of gravity falls on the base

1561
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,570
and how far we extend the
base back was really small,

1562
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:42,260
it would take a very, very small
tipping moment to actually tip it over.

1563
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,920
So that would just be very
impractical because you

1564
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:47,190
would have to very delicately
place your phone inside.

1565
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:52,400
So I just added maybe a
quarter of an inch or half

1566
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,770
inch beyond what we needed.

1567
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:56,954
I did not calculate the required
tipping moment to take this over.

1568
01:14:56,954 --> 01:14:58,620
I think that might be a little overkill.

1569
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:02,631
>> But physically, that's
how it would be done.

1570
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:03,130
Cool.

1571
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:04,930
So now, we have this assembly saved.

1572
01:15:04,930 --> 01:15:09,010
You could make a more detailed
iPhone if you wanted dimensions.

1573
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:12,590
I had made this little
extrusion for the Home button,

1574
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,880
and this is iPhone specific.

1575
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,360
But if your phone's in
the dock, you can just

1576
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:20,610
turn it on without having to take
it out and look at all the text

1577
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:26,270
messages that you're getting
or SnapChats, my preference.

1578
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:32,280
>> So another assumption, viewers at home
might be thinking, Ansel, you idiot!

1579
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,670
You assumed that the phone was
uniformly distributed mass wise,

1580
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:44,090
like that mass inside the boundaries
of the phone is uniformly distributed.

1581
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:45,200
That is not the case.

1582
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,370
But I think that's a fine assumption.

1583
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:49,200
So we can save this assembly.

1584
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:53,132
We'll call it iPhone in dock.

1585
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:53,840
We're good to go.

1586
01:15:53,840 --> 01:16:00,590
>> So you can create really complicated
or ornate, involved assemblies

1587
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:02,260
from many, many parts.

1588
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:07,100
Just know that each part has a certain
number of fixtures and lines associated

1589
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:07,600
with it.

1590
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,720
So if you have an assembly
with a lot of parts

1591
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,890
and you want to move it around and
measure and do a lot of things,

1592
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:17,900
it can become laggy depending on
how powerful your computer is.

1593
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:22,440
Just something to be
aware of that will happen.

1594
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,940
>> So that is kind of an intro to CAD.

1595
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:30,530
The takeaways, I would say, are
definitely add relations everywhere.

1596
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:32,880
You will kick yourself
in the rump if you don't.

1597
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:39,090
It's very painful to go back later
and change redundant dimensions.

1598
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:40,310
It's useless, right?

1599
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:44,490
You always want to dimension everything
such that you dimension one number,

1600
01:16:44,490 --> 01:16:46,450
and then add relations from that number.

1601
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:47,710
That's a huge takeaway.

1602
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:50,960
Just being clean, just like when you're
writing code, being clean and labeling

1603
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:51,600
everything.

1604
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:58,980
Labeling your features-- you'll notice
that when we made this little lens

1605
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:00,710
support, everything is labeled.

1606
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:03,960
If you don't make this in house
and you ship it to somebody,

1607
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:07,420
most places, maybe 95% of
machine shops or whatever,

1608
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:09,920
will take a SolidWorks
part file, you don't even

1609
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,710
have to make drawings for it,
you just send them this file.

1610
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,710
And they'll be able to get every
measurement they need off of this file.

1611
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:19,590
And it's a lot easier for them to work
with if everything is neatly organized.

1612
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:21,180
You can even add folders.

1613
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:25,460
We can select the bottom feature,
hit Shift, or rather hold down Shift,

1614
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,524
and select the top.

1615
01:17:26,524 --> 01:17:28,440
And everything in the
middle becomes selected.

1616
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,090
And then right click adds a new folder.

1617
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:34,245
We'll call it awesome folder.

1618
01:17:34,245 --> 01:17:36,820

1619
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:39,412
And now, everything is in a folder.

1620
01:17:39,412 --> 01:17:42,120
Things like that, just making
everything very neat and organized,

1621
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,990
another takeaway.

1622
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,360
>> And then ultimately,
being very explicit.

1623
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:49,410
So there are relations between
something that you've already defined

1624
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:52,100
and other things that are
related to it, but then there

1625
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,420
are also dimension relations.

1626
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:57,070
So it's really important to
be explicit and make sure

1627
01:17:57,070 --> 01:18:00,470
that everything in your sketch is
completely black before you move on.

1628
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:04,450
So at this point, I'm going to
open the floor up to questions,

1629
01:18:04,450 --> 01:18:06,950
and we can start to talk a
little bit more about that.

1630
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:10,480
And then, once questions are done,
I'll show you the render process pretty

1631
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:15,070
quickly wherein we can generate a
really realistic looking image of this.

1632
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:19,890
When you're looking at this in CAD, it
just looks kind of a dull gray blob.

1633
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:24,010
But when you do a render, it will
be very, very realistic looking.

1634
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,620
So questions?

1635
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,970
>> AUDIENCE: MakerBot stuff?

1636
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,145
>> ANSEL DUFF: Any other questions?

1637
01:18:30,145 --> 01:18:36,334
The MakerBot is, no fault of
our own, actually, no, it's

1638
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:37,500
definitely fault of our own.

1639
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,230
We have lost a couple sheets,
the tape sheets on the bottom.

1640
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:45,446
So once we get those in,
we'll be able to print again.

1641
01:18:45,446 --> 01:18:46,494
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1642
01:18:46,494 --> 01:18:47,660
ANSEL DUFF: Oh, what's that?

1643
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,542
Oh, yeah.

1644
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:50,750
I thought you were talking
about the actual MakerBot.

1645
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:52,500
76%, wow.

1646
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,486
It's going so slowly.

1647
01:18:54,486 --> 01:18:57,420
I thought you meant can we print yet.

1648
01:18:57,420 --> 01:18:59,378
AUDIENCE: You put together
the tutorial online.

1649
01:18:59,378 --> 01:19:04,474
Does that include the best resources
for people to remember what to click

1650
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:07,684
and how to do some of the
things you went through today?

1651
01:19:07,684 --> 01:19:08,350
ANSEL DUFF: Yes.

1652
01:19:08,350 --> 01:19:12,120
So there is-- the MakerBot tutorial,
is that what you're referring to?

1653
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,830
>> AUDIENCE: The one you
put on the website.

1654
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:16,960
>> ANSEL DUFF: Yeah, this one.

1655
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,990
So this is MakerBot specific.

1656
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:21,830
This is not SolidWorks specific.

1657
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:24,870
I hope that this video will be
available in high resolution

1658
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:30,890
as a reference to the syntax and
the GUI associated with SolidWorks.

1659
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:36,000
But the tutorials, I think, are super
helpful as far as getting started goes.

1660
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:42,430
So when I hit New, or even use a hot
key for that, but if we go to File, New,

1661
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:45,470
we get this prompt box where
we would typically select part.

1662
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:48,090
But if we hit this
tutorials box, then we

1663
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:50,720
are venturing into the
world of the tutorial.

1664
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:57,090
>> So this is how I learned SolidWorks,
was doing a bunch of these tutorials.

1665
01:19:57,090 --> 01:20:00,380
In fact, if you take
CS 51, which is kind

1666
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,120
of the intro to computer
and machine design class,

1667
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,800
they will require, I
think, the first p-set zero

1668
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,594
is doing all these tutorials.

1669
01:20:08,594 --> 01:20:09,510
They're super helpful.

1670
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:10,410
They're quick.

1671
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:13,730
You follow along in your own time.

1672
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:15,612
They're a good way to
learn the commands.

1673
01:20:15,612 --> 01:20:18,320
I know I was starting to go a
little bit quickly towards the end.

1674
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,759
>> AUDIENCE: Do they have cheat
sheets or PDFs you've come across?

1675
01:20:21,759 --> 01:20:23,300
ANSEL DUFF: Yeah, so there is a page.

1676
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,690
I'll put it on the staff site.

1677
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:29,690
There is a page with a bunch
of hot keys for SolidWorks.

1678
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:31,840
SolidWorks is also super configurable.

1679
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,450
Like, you can change
just about everything.

1680
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:37,300
If we go back to the main page--
I'm just going to cancel this.

1681
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:41,300
If we go back to the main page, if you
don't like this toolbar being there,

1682
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,152
you can drag it and put off to the side.

1683
01:20:43,152 --> 01:20:45,610
I'll put it back up top, because
I think it's the cleanest.

1684
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,180
You can change just about everything.

1685
01:20:47,180 --> 01:20:50,475
If you want everything to be in
millimeters, you can change that.

1686
01:20:50,475 --> 01:20:52,600
You'll notice, when we were
dimensioning something,

1687
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:56,150
let's go back here, that
everything's to two decimal places.

1688
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:56,860
That's rubbish.

1689
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,134
Let's make it to three.

1690
01:20:58,134 --> 01:21:00,050
We'll go to Document
Properties up here, which

1691
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:03,270
is two icons over from the stop light.

1692
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:07,590
Document Properties,
Dimensions, and then we

1693
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:09,290
set this to three decimal places.

1694
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:10,050
Hit OK.

1695
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:12,570
Everything changes to
three decimal places.

1696
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:15,280
You can customize up the wazoo.

1697
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,560
>> But the biggest thing, I think the
most useful user aspect of SolidWorks

1698
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,540
are hotkeys, just like
many programs out there.

1699
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:26,620
I've been using them a lot,
mainly holding down Control

1700
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:30,500
to add relations, Shift to highlight
multiple things, and F to fit,

1701
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:33,867
like if we zoom out and then hit
F. It fits the part in our view.

1702
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:35,950
But there are many, many,
many, many more hotkeys.

1703
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:38,690
And I will put the page on the
staff site that lists all them,

1704
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,010
and they're super useful.

1705
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,972
And just little shortcuts
like double clicking

1706
01:21:41,972 --> 01:21:43,430
when you're drawing a line to exit.

1707
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:46,590

1708
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:48,242
Any other questions?

1709
01:21:48,242 --> 01:21:50,367
>> AUDIENCE: Where do you [INAUDIBLE]?

1710
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:51,450
ANSEL DUFF: That's hidden.

1711
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:52,860
That is hidden.

1712
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:55,419
>> AUDIENCE: Why is the MakerBot
printing that [INAUDIBLE]?

1713
01:21:55,419 --> 01:21:56,960
ANSEL DUFF: So that's actually a bug.

1714
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,110
I contacted the manufacturer.

1715
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:03,230
There's somebody with the same
name at that organization.

1716
01:22:03,230 --> 01:22:09,189
>> AUDIENCE: The random one when you
did the plane tangent to the hole,

1717
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:11,272
is it then possible once
you've drawn on the plane

1718
01:22:11,272 --> 01:22:14,950
to make the plane itself
curve to fit on the surface?

1719
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:18,307
What if you drew something
on the plane to eventually go

1720
01:22:18,307 --> 01:22:21,736
onto the surface itself.

1721
01:22:21,736 --> 01:22:22,860
ANSEL DUFF: Great question.

1722
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:27,690
So let's go back here to
bottom plane, normal to it.

1723
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:32,700
Sometimes after a restless night,
my bottom plane is not there either.

1724
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,310
But hit bottom plane.

1725
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,830
We're good to go.

1726
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:39,950
The question was, if we draw something
on the plane, can it wrap around?

1727
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:42,970
Or rather, can the plane itself
wrap around to a curved surface?

1728
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:45,220
And the answer to that,
disappointingly, is no.

1729
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:50,400
You cannot wrap a plane to a face that
is not planar, not completely flat.

1730
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:55,110
But if we did, watch, let's
go back and sketch on here.

1731
01:22:55,110 --> 01:23:03,915
And we'll write, I don't
know, let's write SolidWorks.

1732
01:23:03,915 --> 01:23:08,010

1733
01:23:08,010 --> 01:23:13,170
>> If we wanted extrude this here,
even though we sketched it

1734
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:18,700
on a plane that was tangent to the
curved surface, it will still work

1735
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,960
and it'll still take
to a curved surface.

1736
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,960
If that makes any sense.

1737
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,860
You can make holes, any feature
that you want in a sketch,

1738
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,000
and then apply that to a curved surface.

1739
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,800
But all the sketching has
to be done on a plane.

1740
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,200
Also, the nice thing about the feature
tree is that once you create something,

1741
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,170
it's easy to pick and choose
what you want in your assembly.

1742
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:43,710
So like this, SolidWorks looks
ridiculous because it's overflowing.

1743
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:46,870
>> So if we wanted to kind of put i
on a shelf and use it later down

1744
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:51,760
the road, we don't want it right now,
if we just hit Suppress, it goes away.

1745
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:55,319
So all I did was I left clicked, and
then this little dialogue box pops up.

1746
01:23:55,319 --> 01:23:56,610
You have a ton of options here.

1747
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,390
I just hit suppress.

1748
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:00,090
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1749
01:24:00,090 --> 01:24:02,710
>> ANSEL DUFF: If we want it gone,
or rather if we want it back,

1750
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,090
we just hit Unsuppress.

1751
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:06,190
It's back.

1752
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,440
So that's a really useful feature.

1753
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,509
Not so much in parts, but
when you have an assembly,

1754
01:24:11,509 --> 01:24:13,800
there are a couple other--
I'll go back to the assembly

1755
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,170
and show you some cool
assembly features.

1756
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:22,500
So if we wanted to see how the
phone how the fillets morph

1757
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,320
to the fillets of the dock,
we can highlight this.

1758
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,750
So we go to dock.

1759
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,940
Then we hit Change Transparency.

1760
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,270
This makes it semi-transparent.

1761
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:36,970
You'll notice that the fillets that
we made here, there's plenty of space.

1762
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:39,430
>> Additionally, we'll change that back.

1763
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:44,240
You can also view in plane while
moving through the depth of the part.

1764
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,620
So this little count,
it's like a half donut.

1765
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:48,190
It's called Section View.

1766
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:53,797
If we hit that, actually,
we want a different plane.

1767
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,204
Let's do top plane.

1768
01:24:55,204 --> 01:25:00,450

1769
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:05,167
>> So we hit Section View, and
then move this in and out.

1770
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:06,000
Kind of hard to see.

1771
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,180
We'll zoom in a little bit.

1772
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:11,800
But this actually takes your field
of view, your plane of vision,

1773
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,500
and pushes it through the part.

1774
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,000
So what's blue is actual material.

1775
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,510
There's a phone, there's a fillet.

1776
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:21,420
It's not that interesting for this part.

1777
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:23,630
But this can be done in
both assemblies and parts.

1778
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:26,150
So if we go back to
our lens support, then

1779
01:25:26,150 --> 01:25:30,300
hit the same thing,
little half donut here.

1780
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:31,600
It's kind of cool to see.

1781
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,740
>> Sometimes, when you're designing
a complicated internal feature,

1782
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:36,970
this is really useful
to check clearances,

1783
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:40,870
as a sanity check to make sure that
holes are concentric, what have you.

1784
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:43,590
But you can just move it up and down.

1785
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:48,615
I'm just holding it down, left clicking,
and it will show you everything.

1786
01:25:48,615 --> 01:25:49,865
This can be done on any plane.

1787
01:25:49,865 --> 01:25:53,830

1788
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:56,230
So we'll see if the MakerBot is done.

1789
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:56,790
Oh, 80%.

1790
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:59,150
We'll do the render and we'll come back.

1791
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:02,660
>> So we had defined this
part to be aluminum.

1792
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:07,050
We had also defined its
appearance to be gray.

1793
01:26:07,050 --> 01:26:09,490
We'll do polished aluminum.

1794
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:13,750
So as far as SolidWorks is
concerned, it's appearance

1795
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:16,332
is completely taken care
of, completely defined.

1796
01:26:16,332 --> 01:26:18,040
So now, we're going
to go and we're going

1797
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:20,490
to make a really realistic render of it.

1798
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:23,330
It's going to look as
it would in real life.

1799
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:33,740
So the package I have enabled here
is, actually, I don't have it enabled.

1800
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:39,890
If there's something, you can pick
and choose which tools are displayed.

1801
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:43,770
>> The package that we have in our
office has everything available,

1802
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:46,950
the academic license has
every feature that SolidWorks

1803
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:49,190
makes incorporate in our package.

1804
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,530
But not all of them are showing.

1805
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:55,600
So if you want to add or subtract
from this menu, just right click.

1806
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,919
Nope.

1807
01:26:56,919 --> 01:26:58,960
You right click, and then
you get this list here.

1808
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,710
So we want Render Tools.

1809
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:04,896
Render Tools uses an engine called
Photo View 360, which may or may not

1810
01:27:04,896 --> 01:27:05,420
be enabled.

1811
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:10,790
So to double check, we'll
go to Tools, Add-ins,

1812
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:12,710
and then we select Photo View 360.

1813
01:27:12,710 --> 01:27:13,514
Hit OK.

1814
01:27:13,514 --> 01:27:14,430
Now, we're good to go.

1815
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:16,620
So we go to Render Tools.

1816
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:18,122
You can do a preview render.

1817
01:27:18,122 --> 01:27:19,830
But it's not going to
do anything for us.

1818
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:23,320
So we're going all
the way, final render.

1819
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,960
And this will take a little
bit of time to process.

1820
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,444
But it'll look pretty cool.

1821
01:27:27,444 --> 01:27:35,730

1822
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:39,380
>> So there are all these parameters on
the right hand side that we can adjust.

1823
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:43,990
The resolution, lighting,
where the light's coming from,

1824
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:46,819
the diffusivity of the surface.

1825
01:27:46,819 --> 01:27:47,860
Those are all adjustable.

1826
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:49,420
But we're just using the defaults.

1827
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:52,660
You can even move it
around a little bit.

1828
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:54,920
You can see it's really shiny.

1829
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:57,419
All the fillets are glistening.

1830
01:27:57,419 --> 01:27:58,460
Oops, just lost my power.

1831
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:01,493
All the fillets are glistening.

1832
01:28:01,493 --> 01:28:06,160
Sky is the limit as far as that goes.

1833
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:08,920
It's pretty cool.

1834
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,190
>> For some letters, and in
fact a doorknob that we

1835
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:19,220
had designed a little bit earlier,
I had done a render of the door

1836
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:21,930
handle also in false aluminum,
and this is what it looks like.

1837
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:29,675

1838
01:28:29,675 --> 01:28:31,800
There are some more advanced
features with renders,

1839
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,960
like you can add-- like if you were
designing a battery pack, for example,

1840
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,180
you can have a sticker that
says high voltage or decals.

1841
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:41,020
You can import your own
decals and add them.

1842
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:46,250
So it's very product designy.

1843
01:28:46,250 --> 01:28:50,776
85%, I'm dying to know how
long this is going to take.

1844
01:28:50,776 --> 01:28:51,627
Yes?

1845
01:28:51,627 --> 01:28:53,710
AUDIENCE: You are printing
something that's solid,

1846
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:56,251
and then you have something
that's [INAUDIBLE] in the middle.

1847
01:28:56,251 --> 01:29:01,230
MakerBot and SolidWorks work together
and printed in a way that [INAUDIBLE]?

1848
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:05,130

1849
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:06,370
>> ANSEL DUFF: Great question.

1850
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:10,330
So the question was, is there a way
for us to print internal features?

1851
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:12,830
Internal features are
something that's suspended.

1852
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:16,530
A good example is like if
you were to print an A,

1853
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:19,610
the center triangle of the A
is an internal feature that's

1854
01:29:19,610 --> 01:29:20,830
completely suspended.

1855
01:29:20,830 --> 01:29:26,670
Or rather, if you were to print
a hook that's overarching,

1856
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:29,987
when the printer wants to get to the
level where this part of the book

1857
01:29:29,987 --> 01:29:31,820
first starts, there's
nothing holding it up.

1858
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:33,340
It can't just print in mid-air.

1859
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:37,880
Those are called internal features
or suspended features, many names

1860
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:39,040
for the same idea.

1861
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:43,040
>> But the answer to your
question is yes and no.

1862
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:46,330
SolidWorks does not do
anything to that extent.

1863
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:48,820
SolidWorks is a CADing
and simulation program.

1864
01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:55,235
And we can design really
precise and advanced parts.

1865
01:29:55,235 --> 01:29:57,710
And even create CAM and G code for them.

1866
01:29:57,710 --> 01:30:00,210
But it doesn't really care
about how we make them.

1867
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:04,790
It only cares about us designing them
very precisely and very efficiently.

1868
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:10,250
>> However, once we've exported our
part as a .obj or .stl-- side note,

1869
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:13,703
if you have the option to choose between
exporting using the file formats .obj

1870
01:30:13,703 --> 01:30:17,121
and .stl, always go with STL.

1871
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:20,370
Once we've exported and we put it into
the MakerBot desktop application, which

1872
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:24,372
is what we're looking at right now, we
have the option of creating supports,

1873
01:30:24,372 --> 01:30:26,080
printing these little
support structures.

1874
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,700
They're little towers
that taper off at the end

1875
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:30,340
and then hold those internal features.

1876
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:32,946
So if we wanted to print
a hook, for example,

1877
01:30:32,946 --> 01:30:35,070
when it prints this part
of the hook, it would also

1878
01:30:35,070 --> 01:30:36,730
start to print a little tower.

1879
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:39,690
And then, when the tower gets
close to this base of the hook,

1880
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:42,317
it would taper off into a really,
really small plastic feature.

1881
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:44,150
And that will support
this part of the hook.

1882
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,250
Then, it would just join the two.

1883
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:48,480
>> And we do have the option
of printing like that.

1884
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,980
That option is turned off right now.

1885
01:30:49,980 --> 01:30:52,510
We haven't really needed it.

1886
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:54,419
But yes, we can do that.

1887
01:30:54,419 --> 01:30:55,460
And that's how it's done.

1888
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:55,980
You print supports.

1889
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:58,420
And then, once everything
is done, just break it away

1890
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:00,835
and you can peel the supports off.

1891
01:31:00,835 --> 01:31:05,370

1892
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:09,255
Any other questions,
concerns, comments, remarks?

1893
01:31:09,255 --> 01:31:11,880
>> AUDIENCE: Yeah, supports.

1894
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,820
Within the shapes?

1895
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:15,796
I'm thinking like going
back to the A example, what

1896
01:31:15,796 --> 01:31:19,330
if the A had something
hanging down from the top?

1897
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:22,756
Then the support is
latched onto the A itself.

1898
01:31:22,756 --> 01:31:25,140

1899
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:27,890
ANSEL DUFF: I can't say for sure
without actually trying to do it.

1900
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:29,240
But it would be cool.

1901
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,460
I would imagine that
they could print supports

1902
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:36,430
that are on the side of the A that
don't interfere with your part.

1903
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:39,530
Some internal features are going
to become kind of a lost cause.

1904
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:44,240
For example, if you wanted to print a
sphere with a smaller sphere located

1905
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:49,090
internally, they're both
independent, not attached at all,

1906
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:51,634
it would probably try to
print supports inside it.

1907
01:31:51,634 --> 01:31:54,800
But then, you'd never be able to remove
those supports unless you cut a hole

1908
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,970
and peeled them out.

1909
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:59,720
>> So it almost takes a
little bit of foresight

1910
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,850
when you're designing the part
and getting the part prepared

1911
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:06,730
for print to ensure that
it will be printable.

1912
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:10,440
So like this feature, when it
first imported, it was vertical.

1913
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:13,070
That would be really challenging
for the printer to print.

1914
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:18,140
So always make sure that
you lay it on its side.

1915
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:18,980
And you'll be set.

1916
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:30,360

1917
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,720
88%.

1918
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,450
We will sit here until it's done!

1919
01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:40,350

1920
01:32:40,350 --> 01:32:43,100
>> [APPLAUSE]

1921
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,248
