BRIAN SCASSELLATI: One of the really
great things about computer science

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,500
is that, with even only
a few weeks of study,

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,450
you're able to understand some of the
software and the intelligent structures

5
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,240
that are all around us
in the modern world.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,129
In this short video series, we're
going to be talking about some

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,210
of these different tools
that are out there.

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,370
We'll talk about things like how Netflix
is able to suggest movies for you

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:27,490
that you might like, how Facebook
is able to tag photos of you

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,190
with your name, how Siri is
able to answer your questions,

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,390
or how at Google an autonomous
car is able to drive on the roads.

12
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,820
>> You'll find that each of
these different systems

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,600
runs on basic concepts that
map back to the concepts

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,590
that we've talked about in class.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,030
So I hope you'll join
me, watch these videos,

16
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,830
and see that the things that
you studied here actually

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,390
give you a great amount of leverage on
the structures in the world around you.

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,330
I think you'll be surprised
by just how much you know.

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,556
