DOUG LLOYD: All right, so
bubble sort is an algorithm

4
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,730
you can use to sort a set of elements.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,850
Let's take a look at how it works.

6
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,240
>> So the basic idea behind
bubble sort is this.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,340
We generally want to move higher
valued elements generally to the right,

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,340
and lower valued elements generally
to the left, as we would expect.

9
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,256
We want the lower things to be at
the beginning, and the higher things

10
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,970
to be at the end.

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,130
>> How do we do this?

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,040
Well in pseudocode code,
we could say, let's

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,320
set a swap counter to a non-zero value.

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,570
We'll see why we do that in a second.

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,090
And then we repeat the following
process until the swap counter is 0,

16
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,910
or until we make no swaps at all.

17
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,170
>> Reset the swap counter to
0 if it's not already 0.

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,420
Then look at every
adjacent pair of elements.

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,550
If those two elements are
not in order, swap them,

20
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,620
and add 1 to the swap counter.

21
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,870
If you're thinking about
this before you visualize it,

22
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,471
notice that this will move lower
valued elements to the left

23
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,720
and higher valued elements to the right,
effectively doing what we want to do,

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,940
which is move those groups
of elements in that way.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,035
Let's visualize how this
might look using our array

26
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:10,504
that we used to test
out these algorithms.

27
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:13,420
We have an unsorted array here again,
indicated by all of the elements

28
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,840
being in red.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,970
And I set my swap counter
to a nonzero value.

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,610
I arbitrarily chose
negative 1-- it's not 0.

31
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,840
We want to repeat this process
until the swap counter is 0.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,540
This is why I set my swap
counter to some non-zero value,

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,400
because otherwise the
swap counter would be 0.

34
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,610
We wouldn't even begin the
process of the algorithm.

35
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,610
So again, the steps are--
reset the swap counter

36
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,900
to 0, then look at every adjacent
pair, and if they're out of order,

37
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,514
swap them, and add 1
to the swap counter.

38
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:41,680
So let's begin this process.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,430
So the first thing we do is
we set the swap counter to 0,

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,660
and then we start looking
at each adjacent pair.

41
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,140
>> So we first start looking at 5 and 2.

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,410
We see that they are out of
order and so we swap them.

43
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,830
And we add 1 to the swap counter.

44
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,860
So now our swap counter is 1,
and 2 and 5 have been switched.

45
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,370
Now we repeat the process again.

46
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,540
>> We look at the next adjacent pair,
5 and 1-- they're also out of order,

47
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,960
so we swap them and add
1 to the swap counter.

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,900
Then we look at 5 and 3.

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,830
They are out of order, so we swap
them and we add 1 to the swap counter.

50
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,550
Then we look at 5 and 6.

51
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,630
They're in order, so we don't actually
need to swap anything this time.

52
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,250
Then we look at 6 and 4.

53
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,920
They're also out of order, so we swap
them and we add 1 to the swap counter.

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,230
>> Now notice what's happened.

55
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,514
We've moved 6 all the way to the end.

56
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:32,180
So in selection sort, if you've
seen that video, what we did was

57
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,290
we ended up moving the
smallest elements in building

58
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,640
the sorted array essentially from
left to right, smallest to largest.

59
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,200
In the case of bubble sort, if we're
following this particular algorithm,

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,720
we're actually going to be building
the sorted array from right

61
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,100
to left, largest to smallest.

62
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,840
We have effectively bubbled 6, the
largest value, all the way to the end.

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,165
>> And so we can now declare
that that is sorted,

64
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:59,130
and in future iterations--
going through the array again--

65
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,280
we don't have to consider 6 anymore.

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,850
We only have to consider
the unsorted elements

67
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,299
when we're looking at adjacent pairs.

68
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,340
So we have finished one
pass through bubble sort.

69
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,941
So now we go back to the question,
repeat until the swap counter is 0.

70
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,690
Well the swap counter
is 4, so we're going

71
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,410
to keep repeating this process again.

72
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,180
>> We're going to reset the swap counter
to 0, and look at each adjacent pair.

73
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,890
So we start with 2 and 1-- they're
out of order, so we swap them

74
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,620
and we add 1 to the swap counter.

75
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,490
2 and 3, they're in order.

76
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,060
We don't need to do anything.

77
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,420
3 and 5 are in order.

78
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,150
We don't need to do anything there.

79
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,515
>> 5 and 4, they are out
of order, and so we

80
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:35,130
need to swap them and add
1 to the swap counter.

81
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,880
And now we've moved 5,
the next largest element,

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,920
to the end of the unsorted portion.

83
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,360
So we can now call that
part of the sorted portion.

84
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,180
>> Now you're looking at the
screen and probably can tell,

85
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,130
as can I, that the array
is sorted right now.

86
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,820
But we can't prove that yet.

87
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,359
We don't have a guarantee
that it's sorted.

88
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,900
But this is where the swap
counter's going to come into play.

89
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,060
>> So we've completed a pass.

90
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,357
The swap counter is 2.

91
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:02,190
So we're going to repeat
this process again,

92
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,290
repeat until the swap counter is 0.

93
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,550
Reset the swap counter to 0.

94
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,820
So we'll reset it.

95
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,810
>> Now look at each adjacent pair.

96
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,880
That's in order, 1 and 2.

97
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,590
2 and 3 are in order.

98
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,010
3 and 4 are in order.

99
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,250
So at this point, notice we've completed
looking at every adjacent pair,

100
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,530
but the swap counter is still 0.

101
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,520
>> If we don't have to switch
any elements, then they

102
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,340
must be in order, by
virtue of this process.

103
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,000
And so an efficiency of sorts,
that we computer scientists love,

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,560
is we can now declare
the entire array must

105
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,160
be sorted, because we didn't
have to swap any elements.

106
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,380
That's pretty nice.

107
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,260
>> So what's the worst case
scenario with bubble sort?

108
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,240
In the worst case the array is
in completely reverse order,

109
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,870
and so we have to bubble each
of the large elements all

110
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,780
the way across the array.

111
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,350
And we effectively also have to
bubble all of the small elements back

112
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,050
all the way across the array, too.

113
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,950
So each of the n elements has to move
across all of the other n elements.

114
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,102
So that's the worst case scenario.

115
00:05:04,102 --> 00:05:05,810
In the best case
scenario though, this is

116
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,880
slightly different from selection sort.

117
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,040
The array is already
sorted when we go in.

118
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,550
We don't have to make any
swaps on the first pass.

119
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,940
So we might have to look
at fewer elements, right?

120
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,580
We don't have to repeat this
process a number of times over.

121
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,540
>> So what does that mean?

122
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,390
So what's the worst case scenario
for bubble sort, and what's

123
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,330
the best case scenario for bubble sort?

124
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,770
Did you guess this?

125
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:32,420
In the worst case you have to iterate
across all the n elements n times.

126
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,220
So the worst case is n squared.

127
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,550
>> If the array is perfectly
sorted though, you only

128
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,580
have to look at each
of the elements once.

129
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,670
And if the swap counter is still 0,
you can say this array is sorted.

130
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,780
And so in the best case, this is
actually better than selection

131
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,230
sort-- it's omega of n.

132
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,270
>> I'm Doug Lloyd.
