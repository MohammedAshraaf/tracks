>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,740
>> DOUG LLOYD: So let's take one more
video to talk about one more language.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,800
This time we'll talk about CSS.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,460
So CSS, which is short for
Cascading Style Sheets,

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,149
is another language we use
when constructing websites.

6
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,190
Think about it like this.

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,900
If HTML is what we use to organize the
content we want to put on our page,

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,390
CSS is the tool that we generally use
to customize how our websites look,

9
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,410
and how the user experience really
is, interacting with our website.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,535
>> Similar to HTML, CSS is
not a programming language.

11
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:33,451
It doesn't have logic.

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,595
It doesn't have variables.

13
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:38,890
It doesn't have any sort of that
flow related things that C does.

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,150
It's a styling language.

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,810
And its syntax is pretty
simple, and just describes

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,240
how the elements of our
page have certain HTML

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,190
elements should be modified.

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,170
To that end, if you haven't
yet watched our video on HTML,

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,290
or are unfamiliar with
HTML generally, you

20
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,430
may want to take a look at that
first, because this discussion of CSS

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,700
is going to depend on
some knowledge of HTML.

22
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,740
>> So here's a really
simple CSS stylesheet.

23
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,480
Even if you've never
programmed with CSS before,

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,624
I'm pretty sure you can figure out
exactly what this stylesheet does.

25
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:11,290
What does it do?

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,470
Well, applied to the body of our web
page, everything between body tags

27
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,631
on our HTML, and it sets the
background color of that page to blue.

28
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,130
Well, it's a very simple stylesheet.

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,269
It's actually very human
friendly language, CSS.

30
00:01:23,269 --> 00:01:26,560
So even if you've never used it before,
you probably could guess what that did.

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,140
In fact, if we loaded a page, where
this stylesheet was embedded somehow,

32
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,240
the background color of our page would
be blue, and not the standard white.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,670
>> So how do we build stylesheets?

34
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,700
Well first, we have to
identify a selector.

35
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,970
In the last example,
that selector was body.

36
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,050
Then we have an open
curly brace, and we're

37
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,410
going to begin defining the
stylesheet for that selector.

38
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,800
In between the curly braces, we
just have a list of key value pairs.

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,205
The previous value pair was
background color blue semicolon,

40
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,830
but we could do more and more of these.

41
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,330
You could have multiple things applying
to that tag, that selector body.

42
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,960
Each one of them is separated by a
semicolon, and we call each one of them

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,949
a declaration, a CSS declaration.

44
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,410
When we're done with all the styling we
want to apply to that particular tag,

45
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,300
we just have a closing curly
brace to end the stylesheet,

46
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,640
and we're done defining the stylesheet
for that particular selector.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,341
>> What are some common CSS properties?

48
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,590
Well, maybe you want to put
a border around something.

49
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,850
So you can say, border,
that would be your key,

50
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,460
and then your values would be,
what style, color, and width

51
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,209
you want it to be.

52
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,530
So the style could be a solid
line, a dotted line, a dashed line,

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,020
a ridge line, which would be wavy line.

54
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,790
Maybe you want to have it
be blue or black or green.

55
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,490
Maybe you want it to be
1 or 2 or 10 pixels wide.

56
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,254
You can specify all of those things.

57
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:46,420
Maybe you want to set the background
color of your page in a particular way.

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,215
We already saw that, setting the
background of the body to be blue.

59
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:52,080
>> Then you can use a key word,
so CSS has certain colors

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,950
that are built into it, blue, green,
black, a very simple colors we know.

61
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,110
But you can also specify any
hex color that you'd like.

62
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:05,190
Recall that colors can be identified
by a set of three hex numbers

63
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,500
from 0 to 255, rg and b, the
red, green, and blue component.

64
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,590
And so we can specify
any color we want by,

65
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,520
instead of using blue or green or black,
using pound and then six digits of hex,

66
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,310
and that would give us
the six digit color.

67
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,850
So that's the background color.

68
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,975
>> We also have the foreground
color, which is usually

69
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:24,140
going to be the text of your page.

70
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,850
And you could similarly do that
with key word and or six digit hex.

71
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,140
So you can specify any color you
want for the text of your page

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,370
against a particular
background color, up above.

73
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,100
You can also change and deal
with font, and the way text

74
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,400
is rendered on the page.

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,010
>> So you can change your font size.

76
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,320
You can use key words, such as extra,
extra small, or xx small, or medium,

77
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,660
large, and so on.

78
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,750
You can use fixed points, 10
point, 12 point, and so on.

79
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,850
You can use percentages, 80%, 20%,
where 100% is the default font

80
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,220
size, which is usually going to
be something like 11 or 12 points.

81
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,659
Or you can even base it off
of the most recent font size.

82
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:04,950
If you just wrote something and you know
what you want is for it to be smaller,

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,241
but you don't know exactly what size you
want it to be, well, you can just say,

84
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:09,330
font size smaller.

85
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,344
And it will base off of the,
just up above, it's font size.

86
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:15,760
And you can get smaller or larger.

87
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,390
So there's a lot of different
ways to specify font size.

88
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,690
>> You can also specify what
font family you want.

89
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,360
If you have a particular
name, there's a way in CSS--

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,270
we're not going to talk about it
here-- to define a very specific font

91
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,980
and embed it into your page.

92
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,620
You can also use generic names.

93
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,540
There's a lot of web safe fonts
that are pre-defined in CSS.

94
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,352
And if you are a user of Microsoft
Office in the last 20 years,

95
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,810
you're probably familiar with
a lot of these web safe fonts

96
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,640
already, Times New Roman, Arial,
Courier New, Georgia, Tahoma, Verdana,

97
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,470
and so on.

98
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,170
Those are all considered web safe fonts.

99
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,169
And actually, part of the
reason they came to be

100
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,140
was to be used to make web-- every page
had access to this default set of fonts

101
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,480
with various serifs, and all this
font stuff we won't get into,

102
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,130
but these are usually
accessible in your CSS,

103
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,029
even if you don't
otherwise define the fonts.

104
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,070
Lastly, you can align your text,
instead of it being, by default, aligned

105
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,310
to the left, you could
align it to the right,

106
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,740
or you could align it centered, or
justified so that it hit both margins.

107
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,800
So those are all options you can use
to change what your text looks like,

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,120
and how it's displayed on your page.

109
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,180
>> Your selectors don't
have to be tags only.

110
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,539
We previously saw a body tag
selector, and tag selector

111
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,580
does look just like that.

112
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,020
You name a tag, and then you
define a stylesheet for that tag.

113
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,660
But you can also do something
called an ID selector.

114
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,390
An ID selector looks pretty similar.

115
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,100
But notice, that now I'm not using
an HTML tag, I'm using, in this case,

116
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,720
#unique, or hash unique.

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,930
If you recall from our
video on HTML, we talked

118
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,620
about how tags can have attributes.

119
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,340
>> And one attribute that applies
to pretty much all HTML tags,

120
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,440
but we didn't talk about it,
is something called an ID tag.

121
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,250
So this particular CSS would
apply only to HTML tag that has

122
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,530
a very specific ID, that you've named.

123
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,000
So if you have somewhere
in your code, somewhere

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,090
in your HTML file, a tag and you
specify as an attribute to that tag,

125
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,060
ID equals unique, this
particular stylesheet

126
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,030
here will only apply in between
that tag with the ID of unique.

127
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,180
>> You can also do something
called a class selector.

128
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,920
So in addition to having
ID attributes, you can also

129
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,130
add a class attribute to HTML tags.

130
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,140
And when you use a class attribute,
it can be applied to multiple tags.

131
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,880
So if you have several things that
are similar, maybe you want to say,

132
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,890
open tag blah, blah, blah,
blah, class equals students.

133
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,190
And then this particular
stylesheet would apply

134
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,041
to every tag whose class is students.

135
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,290
In this case, we'd set the
background color to yellow,

136
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,706
and we'd set opacity, which
is a tag we didn't talk about,

137
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:52,510
but just deals with how transparent
something is, to 70%, in this case.

138
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,430
>> There's two options for
writing stylesheets.

139
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,680
You can write them
directly into your HTML

140
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,690
by placing the stylesheets
in between style tags.

141
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,850
And those style tags go inside of
the head tags of your web page.

142
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,240
The perhaps more preferred way to do
it is to write a separate .css file,

143
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,360
and then link it into your
document using link tags.

144
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,690
Link tags, again, are
different from hyperlinks,

145
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,760
if you recall from our video an HTML.

146
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,030
And link tags are how we
pull in separate files.

147
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,900
It sort of like the equivalent of
the #include for web programming.

148
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,140
>> So let's take a look at table.HTML.

149
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,380
If you recall from our
HTML video, I showed

150
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,000
an example of a very
simple multiplication

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,160
table that looked pretty
ugly, and maybe there's

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,650
a way to make it better with
CSS, to make it actually look

153
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,120
more like a multiplication
table, or something

154
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,730
that isn't just stuck together
with no actual division

155
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,532
between the rows and the columns.

156
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,490
So let's head over to
CS50 IDE, and take a look

157
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,780
at how CSS can, sort of, tweak
what we started with before,

158
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,290
and make it something a lot better.

159
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,650
>> So we're in CS50 IDE
now, and if unfamiliar,

160
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,710
we'll pull up in this
table that HTML page.

161
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,090
Table.HTML basically
just defines the contents

162
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,044
of a multiple-- it was supposed to be
a four by four multiplication table.

163
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:06,210
It's pretty straightforward.

164
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,410
And we would think that it would
look pretty well organized.

165
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,277
But in fact, when we preview this page,
we see that it's kind of ugly, right?

166
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:16,860
Clearly we have rows and columns here.

167
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,350
There some sort of separation.

168
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,040
But it's not a meaningful separation.

169
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,105
We're not actually getting
too much information here.

170
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:25,730
And there's no separation between
the rows and columns in terms

171
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,460
of horizontal or vertical rules.

172
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,530
We could probably make this
look a little bit better.

173
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,934
So let's try.

174
00:08:32,934 --> 00:08:34,559
So I'm going to close this tab up here.

175
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,434
And I'm going to close my table.HTML,
and I have another version here

176
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,490
called table2.HTML.

177
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,655
We'll open that up.

178
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,530
The body of the page is
pretty much the same,

179
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,238
but I've changed a
little bit at the top.

180
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:47,132
And I'll scroll up here.

181
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,340
Notice that this time, I'm
using embedded style tags.

182
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,550
I've opened a style tag, and I'm now
defining a CSS stylesheet just inside

183
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,310
of it.

184
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,310
I have a stylesheet that says, table.

185
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,170
That's my tag selector.

186
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,340
I'm not using dot or hash,
which I would be doing if I

187
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,710
was using an ID or a class selector.

188
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,190
I have a tag selector here-- table.

189
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,090
This style is going to
apply to every table tag.

190
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,950
Apparently I want to put a one
pixel wide, solid blue border,

191
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,779
inside my table.

192
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,320
That sounds like it would probably
help the situation, right?

193
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
We're going to have
things look a lot better.

194
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,190
So this is fine.

195
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,540
Stylistically, I've just
embedded my stylesheet in here.

196
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,100
It's certainly an
acceptable way to do it.

197
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,391
Let's see what this looks like.

198
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:29,790
So I'll go back down here, and
I'll will preview my table2.HTML.

199
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,430

200
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,470
Well, that's not quite what I wanted,
but it is exactly what we asked for.

201
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,530
We said that this style is
going to apply to our table.

202
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,810
Our table now has a one pixel
wide, solid blue border around it.

203
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,237
We're not actually getting
at the table cells.

204
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,570
We're just getting at the table.

205
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,310
So CSS worked.

206
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,890
It has applied a
stylesheet to our table.

207
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,981
But didn't quite do
what we wanted it to do.

208
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:55,730
How do we get to do
what we want it to do?

209
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,287
>> Well, let's take a look at one more
version of this in table3.HTML.

210
00:09:59,287 --> 00:10:00,870
So I'm just going to close these tabs.

211
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,890
I'm going to go back over here to my
file tree, and open up table3.HTML.

212
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,680

213
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,350
Again, it's going to look pretty
similar here at the beginning.

214
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,460
But notice, this time, instead of using
a stylesheet embedded right in there,

215
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,870
I'm going to link in a
stylesheet using the link tag.

216
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,480
So I'm apparently linking in a
stylesheet called tables.CSS,

217
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,090
and this well equals
stylesheet just means-- well,

218
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,645
what is this file relative to what
I'm doing-- is a stylesheet that I'm

219
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:29,821
using for my page.

220
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:32,320
So if I really want to see what
I'm doing with the CSS here,

221
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,010
I need to go open that
table.CSS file as well.

222
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,490
So we'll go back over here
again to our file tree.

223
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,660
There's table.CSS.

224
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,490
We'll pop it open.

225
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,070
Now we're seeing a little of the CSS.

226
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,630
Apparently, I have a couple
of things going on here.

227
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,950
I apparently want to put a five
pixel wide, solid red border,

228
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,287
around my table.

229
00:10:50,287 --> 00:10:52,870
We already know that that's going
to just go on the perimeter.

230
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,180
We saw that in table2.HTML.

231
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,770
With each row, I
apparently want to specify

232
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,950
that the row height is 50 pixels high.

233
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,680
So for every row, remember
that's what the tr tag does,

234
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,550
I'm making it 50 pixels high.

235
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,804
>> Lastly, I have this comment.

236
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:11,470
And this is how we make comments in CSS.

237
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,174
It's very similar to seize block
comments syntax slash star.

238
00:11:16,174 --> 00:11:17,090
All the text you want.

239
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,470
There's no slash slash though in CSS.

240
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,400
For short inline comments, we have
to use this particular format here.

241
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,830
It looks like I'm doing a
lot of things in my td tags.

242
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,710
Remember td tags, or table
data, which really are just

243
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,210
the columns inside of
our rows, and apparently

244
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,090
for each piece of data
in my table, I want

245
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,850
to set the background color to
be black, the color to be white,

246
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,320
color is foreground color.

247
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,360
So this is going to be
the text of my page.

248
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,140
I want big font, 22
point font, and I want

249
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,001
it to be of the font family, Georgia.

250
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,750
So I'm not going to
have the default font.

251
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,820
I'm going to specify Georgia, which
is one of those web safe fonts

252
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,830
that we've seen before.

253
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,284
I want my text to be aligned
centrally, in the middle of the box,

254
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:59,450
I don't want it to be left
aligned or right aligned.

255
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,461
And I want my column width
to be 50 pixels wide as well.

256
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,210
Let's take a look at
what this looks like,

257
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,470
and see if this is maybe an improvement.

258
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,890
So I'm going to go to table3.HTML, which
recall, includes table.CSS as a link,

259
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,830
and we'll preview it.

260
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,800
That's a lot better, right?

261
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,004
This is actually starting to look a
lot more like a multiplication table.

262
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:21,920
I have that red border
around my table but now

263
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,700
I also have specified that
each row is 50 pixels wide,

264
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,220
or it's 50 pixels tall-- excuse
me-- each column is 50 pixels wide.

265
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,251
The data in each column, and only
the data, has a black background.

266
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:36,000
So that's why those
white lines are there.

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,836
Because the space in
between all of those cells,

268
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,710
it's not a border in
and of itself, it's just

269
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,170
I'm only filling in the
cells, which actually

270
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,310
makes the borders of the table, which
apparently did exist all along, it

271
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,887
was just thin white lines.

272
00:12:47,887 --> 00:12:48,720
Now they're visible.

273
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,380
Now they pop off on the screen.

274
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,920
And so this is a very simple
stylesheet that I've applied,

275
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,850
and now my table looks a lot more like
a four by four multiplication table,

276
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:00,950
instead of a just jumbled mess, where
everything is clearly rows and columns,

277
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,717
but not super well organized.

278
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,800
We're really just scratching the surface
of what you can do with CSS here.

279
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,330
Fortunately the CSS documentation
is pretty straightforward.

280
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,000
You'll use several of its
attributes, fairly frequently.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,087
The ones we talked about
earlier in this video.

282
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,170
There are several that you
probably won't use all.

283
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,469
And that's fine, too.

284
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:22,010
But just know, that there's a
lot of documentation out there.

285
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,110
So even if we didn't cover everything,
you're certainly not left on your own.

286
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,780
But CSS is really fun
to experiment with.

287
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,040
And I would strongly encourage you
to play around with your web pages,

288
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,180
and see how you can make them
look and feel to improve the user

289
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,790
experience of visiting your page.

290
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,710
I'm Doug Lloyd.

291
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,980
This is CS50.

292
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,151
