1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,210

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,460
>> NEEL MEHTA: So hello to
everyone who is watching here,

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,450
or watching online, or remotely.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,260
My name is Neel, this is CS50.

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,015
And today's seminar is Responsive
Web Design with Bootstrap.

6
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:15,890
It's a subject that's
very close to my heart.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,598
Hopefully, it will be
close to your heart

8
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:20,880
as well by the end of today's seminar.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,230
So Bootstrap.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,070
How many of you have done any
kind of web development before?

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,090
A good amount?

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,750
A little bit.

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,840
>> So Bootstrap is the world's most
popular, front-end framework.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,430
It's used by-- I've chosen a
couple of random websites--

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,904
Lyft, Newsweek, and Vogue.

16
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:37,320
It's used by a number of websites.

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,020
It's a web design framework that
will let you make your websites

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,610
both beautiful and responsive.

19
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,331
And I'll go over these
two concepts here.

20
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:47,830
Beautiful.

21
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,640
So you have normal website on the
left, which is made by just HTML.

22
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,960
You've learned HTML in class
and in section at length.

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,290
Bootstrap is a way to make
your websites beautiful.

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,860
You can take what's on the
left side of your screen

25
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,651
and turn it into what's on the
right side of your screen with very,

26
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,710
very, very little code.

27
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,480
>> You get the nice blue button, you get
the fancy, rounded edges on the screen,

28
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,220
you get the list view, you get the
cards, and so on with very little code.

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,110
There's actually no CSS that
you have to write by yourself.

30
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,980
So Bootstrap allows you to
have these pre-built CSS

31
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,610
components you can put
inside of your web page

32
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,190
to make it look beautiful without
very much work on your own.

33
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,500
It's really a bootstrap,
a starting point,

34
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,270
for your web development adventures.

35
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,780
And so when you're just
mocking up a website,

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,363
it's a very good place to get started.

37
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:31,990
You can get a good looking website
with very, very little work.

38
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,079
And indeed, we're going
to do this ourselves

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,370
in the course of like five
minutes-- within 10 minutes.

40
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,600
So it's pretty easy to
make some great websites.

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,430
So that's the first part.

42
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,090
>> The second part-- responsive.

43
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,040
People, nowadays, don't just
access the web on their laptops.

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,450
Actually, as of 2014, more people
access the web through mobile devices,

45
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,580
like phones, or tablets, or
services, or so on than websites.

46
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,540
And websites have traditionally been
designed with laptops or desktops

47
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,300
in mind.

48
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,930
And so the websites are often not
very well suited to your phone.

49
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,270
If you ever visited
harvard.edu on your phone,

50
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,479
it's kind of an annoying
experience, right?

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,080
That's because it's not responsive.

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,163
We're trying to make
websites that are responsive,

53
00:02:13,163 --> 00:02:17,360
that respond to people's screen sizes.

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,630
>> So if it's a phone, it's
going to go on phone.

55
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,505
If it's a tablet, it's
going to go on tablet.

56
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,890
It adjusts to match the
screen that is being used.

57
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,294
And so Bootstrap also provides some
very, very useful utilities for that.

58
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:29,960
And we're going to discuss that as well.

59
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,597
So again, there are two parts to
Bootstrap-- beautiful and responsible.

60
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:34,930
We're going to talk about those.

61
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,710
First, beautiful.

62
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,790
And then responsive.

63
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,280
>> So all the code that we're
going to talk about today--

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,363
we're going to have a lot of examples,
a lot of challenges, and so on-- it

65
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:45,949
all lives on this website here.

66
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,240
This slide is what we sent out.

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,280
So if you're here, you can feel
free to not have to write that down.

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,480
And if you're watching remotely, feel
free to pull this up on your computer

69
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:53,980
as well.

70
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,560
You'll probably need it during
the course of this seminar.

71
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,590
>> So we're going to use a
website called CodePen,

72
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,540
which is a collaborative coding
environment, during this seminar.

73
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,620
And CodePen-- and I'll
show you here real fast--

74
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,430
it allows you to write
HTML collaboratively.

75
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,130
I can write it, I can send it to
you guys, you guys can edit it.

76
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,300
Even if you're remote, you
can still access it that way.

77
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,000
You can type HTML code at the
top and it'll automatically

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,140
be converted into the
web page at the bottom.

79
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,640
So it's a way for you
to quickly try out code

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,330
without having to do any kind of stuff
on your IDE, or your own website,

81
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,260
or whatever.

82
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,220
>> So go ahead and pull up this
website, if you're remote

83
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,870
or if you are here,
especially if you're remote.

84
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,770
is.gd/cs50boostrap.

85
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,670
No caps, no underscores, no nothing.

86
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,930
So those of you who are
here, just give me a thumbs

87
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,030
up when you have pulled
up that web page.

88
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:55,980

89
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,660
Good?

90
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,460
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

91
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,489
>> NEEL MEHTA: So we'll get
to that in just a second.

92
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:03,530
So first, we're going to get to, how
do you make your websites beautiful?

93
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,696
We're going to learn how to take boring,
old HTML, like I showed you before,

94
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,980
and turn that into
really nice components,

95
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,230
like nice widgets, nice, colored
buttons, and labels, and tables,

96
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,230
and all, using Bootstrap.

97
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,246
So if we could all go over to the
CodePen that you just pulled up.

98
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:18,829
It should look a little bit like this.

99
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,020
Does it look like this for everyone?

100
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,740
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

101
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,364
>> NEEL MEHTA: If you're remote, it
should look like this as well.

102
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:26,350
If not, I will show you soon how
you can get it look like this

103
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,860
in a future part of the video.

104
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,720
So here we have written
a very basic HTML,

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,300
like the kind you've
been using in class.

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,350
It's pretty basic.

107
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,310
No frills.

108
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,950
And we have some stuff.

109
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,200
We've designed a very,
very basic start up

110
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,000
call Yalp! with which you can
find restaurants in the area,

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,379
and find reviews, and
directions on all of those.

112
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,420
It's a very good concept.

113
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,700
It's never been done before.

114
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,940
It's a very unique name, too.

115
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,270
>> So what we're going to try
to do is help the owner

116
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,150
of Yalp! make his website
look really, really cool.

117
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,560
So to begin with, the owner of
Yalp! has made a little search

118
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,440
box, and a little button,
and then maybe a little

119
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,014
highlighted area for a
highlighted restaurant, and then

120
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:12,300
a list of other restaurants
that are in the area.

121
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,045
So we can just go through
the HTML code real fast.

122
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:16,670
How comfortable are you guys with HTML?

123
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,230
We've done a little bit
section and also in class.

124
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,110
Decent?

125
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,700
>> So just as a recap,
HTML is all about having

126
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,590
tags or elements that tell the
computer how to lay out the web page.

127
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,300
So this h1 here-- start h1, Welcome
to Yalp!, end h1-- tells the computer,

128
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,890
draw a big header it
says, Welcome to Yalp!

129
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,080
inside there.

130
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,290
We also have forms.

131
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,080
We can inputs like this, text inputs,
which will render as text boxes

132
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,530
you write in.

133
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,840
You also have buttons.

134
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,630
You get a nice, clickable button.

135
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,210
It doesn't do anything right
now, but you get a button.

136
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,210
You can have divs, or dividers, to
break up your page into various groups.

137
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,770
>> You can have paragraphs,
you have buttons.

138
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,210
If you have paragraphs, then
you have unordered lists, ul,

139
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,124
and lists inside of that, li.

140
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,540
So these are the very basic
building blocks of a web page.

141
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,415
And indeed, pretty much
every website you see

142
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:12,170
is going to be built
using these same tools.

143
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,420
Of course, they don't all
look this bad because we're

144
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,380
going to spice it up a little bit.

145
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,440
So let's this boring old HTML and start
transforming it into the beautiful site

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,290
that we just saw a couple minutes ago.

147
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,060
>> So let's start off very simple.

148
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,120
So we have this button here.

149
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,960
In Bootstrap, as we saw, we can
have a nice, beautiful, blue button.

150
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,580
And that's done not by doing custom CSS.

151
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,700
There's no custom CSS here.

152
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,970
That's done by adding classes
to your HTML elements.

153
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:49,520
If you've tried classes, or hrefs, or
anchors, or type="text" for inputs--

154
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,240
HTML elements can have these attributes.

155
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,880
They can have extra information
that you might give them.

156
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,290
>> And so, in this case,
classes are the attribute.

157
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,800
So you'd write, button class=
something inside of strings.

158
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,080
And that attribute will tell the
computer, this is not any, old button.

159
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,940
It's a button that is in
this class of buttons.

160
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,335
And so Bootstrap, if you give it
a certain style on your element,

161
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,020
it will draw it a certain way.

162
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,110
So I write "btn btn-primary.

163
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,150
btn being a abbreviation for button.

164
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,000
You'll notice now that
my ugly button turned

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,500
into a nice, beautiful, blue button.

166
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,630
It looks very nice when we click it.

167
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:32,780
>> And so what happens is we have the
btn class and the btn-primary class

168
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,080
on our element.

169
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,340
And Bootstrap will go in and say, OK, I
know that there are these two classes.

170
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,330
Any element that has these two
classes should be drawn like this.

171
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,000
So that's the core of how you attach
styles to elements in Bootstrap.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,480
You just attach classes to them and
it will weight it out as it sees fit.

173
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,440
So here's another example.

174
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,700
In the input, we can add
a class= "form-control".

175
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,140
And I'll show soon where you
can find out what classes

176
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,030
are available of each kind of element.

177
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:10,490
But the class that we just
added has nice, rounded corners,

178
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,230
it has nice padding, it has
a nice, blue glow to it.

179
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,130
>> We can also go into this form.

180
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:22,040
And class="form-inline", which will make
our form, as you might imagine, inline.

181
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,680
So it's looking a little bit more
like what we had before already.

182
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,430
So before we go on to style the rest of
the page, any questions about what we

183
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,930
did?

184
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,971
We just attached classes
to our various elements.

185
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,080
And I'll show you later how you can
figure out what classes are available.

186
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,659
We attached classes that
have certain styles.

187
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,789
And that tells the browser
how to layout the page using

188
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,289
Bootstrap's provided styles.

189
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,920
Any questions from the audience?

190
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,770
>> Good so far?

191
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,290
Cool.

192
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,206
A lot of the challenges
with Bootstrap is just

193
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:51,730
knowing what components are
available and how you use them.

194
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,730
And that is all learned
with experience and also

195
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,180
through reading the documentation,
which we'll talk about soon.

196
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,950
So we have this div.

197
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,520
It's just a boring, old thing.

198
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,710
We want to emphasize it somehow.

199
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,490
So in Bootstrap, there are a
lot of components available.

200
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,190
And this is getbootstrap.com.

201
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,410
It's a very useful reference.

202
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,960
It contains things like--
here's how you do a button.

203
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,710
And you can do nav bars, you can
labels, you can progress bars,

204
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,410
you can do list groups.

205
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,290
Basically, it's all kinds
of you might see a web page.

206
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,180
>> Here's one that we'll try right now.

207
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,150
It's called panel.

208
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,270
If you ever use Google
Now, they have cards.

209
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,050
Or any Android device has cards.

210
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,601
They have little white boxes
that have stuff inside of it.

211
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,350
And so we're going to try and do
that ourselves here using a thing

212
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,480
called a panel.

213
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:44,872
So if we attach class="panel
panel-default" to our outer div,

214
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:49,900
then we attach a div class=-- let's
just check this documentation.

215
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,040
div class="panel-heading" and
then div class="panels-body".

216
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,644

217
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:58,560
Again, don't worry about
memorizing this code.

218
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,510
It will be available online.

219
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,700
>> So we did this and now our boring, old
div turned into this nice, little card.

220
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,580
It has nice padding, it
has borders, it stands out

221
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,760
from the rest of the page,
which is pretty cool.

222
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,524
So let's go in and change this Get
directions button to look nice.

223
00:10:13,524 --> 00:10:16,190
Who in the audience wants to tell
me what I can do to the button

224
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,220
to make it look nice using Bootstrap?

225
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,755

226
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:21,255
Yes?

227
00:10:21,255 --> 00:10:22,905
>> AUDIENCE: We could add a class.

228
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,690
And we could do class="btn btn-primary".

229
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:30,004

230
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:30,960
NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

231
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,040
There's a bunch of other
colors available for buttons--

232
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,590
or for anything, for that matter.

233
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,010
We can do btn-danger and make it red.

234
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,940
There we go.

235
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:50,300
We can do btn-success to make it green.

236
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:57,620
We can do btn-info-- there's a bunch
of things that are available to you.

237
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,550
So I have little challenge for you now.

238
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,730
So there's one more thing
that I have left un-styled.

239
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,870
This Top Restaurants.

240
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,140
>> And we want to use a thing
called a list group to style it.

241
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,530
So my challenge to you is
go on to getbootstrap.com--

242
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,540
I'll pull it up here.

243
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,190
getboostrap.com.

244
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:24,850
Go to getbootstrap.com, find the
section where they go over list groups.

245
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,110
And you'll see here an
example and the right classes

246
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:34,170
that you can use to make your
lists into these nice list groups.

247
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,260
These are worked out examples
of code examples, what

248
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,720
code you use, what HTML code
you use, and what that outputs.

249
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,410
>> So my challenge to you--
go on getbootstrap.com,

250
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,860
whether you're here or at home, and
to try and add styles to this ul

251
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,150
to make it look nice.

252
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,084
And use a list group style.

253
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:54,750
You want to take a couple minutes,
and search the documentation,

254
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,330
try this yourselves?

255
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,710
Because as you're doing web development,
you'll realize a lot of your work

256
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,867
is going to be reading
this documentation.

257
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:04,700
So I think it's good to get familiar
with how to read documentation,

258
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,870
how to figure out what's where,
what code examples you can use,

259
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,160
what you can leverage.

260
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,170
>> So again, getbootstrap.com,
go to the Components tab,

261
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,030
and then scroll down to List Group.

262
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:20,870
And you'll see examples of code that
you can use to make your HTML fit that.

263
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,370
So take a couple of minutes and
try and explore it yourself,

264
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,661
whether you're here or at home.

265
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,660
If you're at home, pause the video,
perhaps, and try it out yourself.

266
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,329
If you're here, if you go to our
website-- if you refresh the page,

267
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:33,370
you'll see this on there.

268
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,970
This very same code is just
adding new styles right there.

269
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,005
So take a few minutes.

270
00:12:38,005 --> 00:12:41,130
Let me know when you are feeling good
about it or when you're totally lost.

271
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,230
Sound good?

272
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,034
Cool.

273
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,450
Quick aside for those of you
at home, while we're waiting,

274
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,080
if you go on to the GitHub site
that I put up a couple slides ago,

275
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,500
towards the beginning of the video,
I have a GitHub repo, repository,

276
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,720
for this talk.

277
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,590
All these code examples that we'll be
talking about are stored right here.

278
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:09,250
So if you go to challenge-1.html, this
is all the code that we have right now

279
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,000
on our CodePen.

280
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,900
So you can just go ahead, and copy
this, and paste it in your own CodePen.

281
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,275
And that way, you can keep up
with what we're doing here.

282
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:19,020
So have this page open as well as we
go through the rest of the seminar.

283
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:33,131

284
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:36,380
Again, you want it to look like what you
see down at the bottom of your screen

285
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,879
there.

286
00:13:36,879 --> 00:14:05,450

287
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,800
Feeling good?

288
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,740
Solid.

289
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,570
Let's wait for everyone else to
finish up with what they're doing.

290
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:41,446

291
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:42,950
>> Yes?

292
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,864
>> AUDIENCE: Suppose that I wanted
to use Bootstrap at home--

293
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:46,530
NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

294
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:52,140
AUDIENCE: I see, on the website,
the Getting Started page.

295
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,671
They give me the options
Bootstrap, Source Code, or Sass.

296
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:58,730
Which of these do I want?

297
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:58,940
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

298
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,620
So the question is, how do you get
started using Bootstrap by ourselves?

299
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,656
It just happens to
magically work right here.

300
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:05,530
So if we have time at
the end of the seminar,

301
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,560
I'll show you how you can
get it on your own web page.

302
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,799
Like here, I've actually
put in some settings that

303
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,590
will have it automatically
loaded, but I'll

304
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,720
show you to do it from
scratch on your own web pages.

305
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,600
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

306
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,680
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

307
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,263
Good question.

308
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:19,520

309
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,500
Feeling good?

310
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,290
Feeling good?

311
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:22,790
Cool.

312
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,919
So who wants to tell me how they made
this thing look nice and Boostrappy?

313
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,585
What's the first class we add to the ul?

314
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:34,347

315
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:35,555
AUDIENCE: class="list-group".

316
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:36,721
NEEL MEHTA: Yes. list-group.

317
00:15:36,721 --> 00:15:38,917

318
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,500
And then what do we attach to the lis?

319
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,072
Someone else?

320
00:15:41,072 --> 00:15:43,405
AUDIENCE: And then, after
that, class="list-group-item".

321
00:15:43,405 --> 00:15:46,230

322
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,950
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

323
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,640
>> AUDIENCE: And it's the
same for the next one.

324
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,265
>> NEEL MEHTA: li class="list-group-item".

325
00:15:50,265 --> 00:15:53,960

326
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,049
There you go.

327
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,340
We have our nice list group,
just like we had expected.

328
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,560
So there you go.

329
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,546
In 10 minutes, we have made
this boring, old Yalp! page

330
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:02,670
look nice and professional.

331
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,549
And that's just the beginning.

332
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,340
So now that you feel
good about that, let's

333
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,850
just go ahead and talk about
a couple more components that

334
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,320
might come in handy as you
go throughout your adventure.

335
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,778
>> Of course, there's a lot ones here.

336
00:16:12,778 --> 00:16:14,940
And now that you've learned
how to do list groups,

337
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,080
you can pretty much teach
yourself how to do any of these.

338
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,770
But, of course, let's just try
and do a couple more ourselves,

339
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,730
just so you get a feel for
how you might use them.

340
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,530
I'm just going to go
to this example here.

341
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,480

342
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,510
Again, the code that I just pasted
in here is available right here.

343
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,630
So feel free to pull it up.

344
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,100
>> So we've already gone through
a couple of these examples.

345
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,850
So we have buttons, which we
have already seen how to do.

346
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,270
We can make buttons larger.

347
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:53,690
By button class-- it goes, btn btn-lg
and btn-default makes it white.

348
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,790
So this makes our button bigger
than it might otherwise be.

349
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,900
It might come in handy, if you have
big submit button or something.

350
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,599
We saw the list group example,
we saw the form example.

351
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,569
>> One very important one is icons.

352
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:13,240
And icons are a way for you to add
interesting things, like check check

353
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,589
marks, or pluses, or friend
icons, or restart icons,

354
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,349
or whatever to your web app.

355
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,400
So again, if we into here,
the components, glyphicons,

356
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,579
are the icons available for Bootstrap.

357
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:28,050
There's an exhaustive
list of all the ones here.

358
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,250
So just as an example,
let's try and add one.

359
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,290
>> So like Facebook, we're to trying
to have an Add Friend button.

360
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,620
Let's first add some style.

361
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,911
button class="btn btn-success".

362
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:40,656

363
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,050
And there we go.

364
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,730
Let's add an icon here.

365
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,080
What icon, do you think,
might make sense to put here?

366
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,632
You've probably seen on
some web pages or whatever,

367
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,590
but what's an example of an icon that
might go well inside this button?

368
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,550

369
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,697
Feel free to browse this view,
if you need any inspiration.

370
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:00,530
There's a lot of useful
ones available here.

371
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:04,330

372
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:04,830
Yes?

373
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,400

374
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,455
>> AUDIENCE: Maybe the glyphicon user one?

375
00:18:13,455 --> 00:18:14,080
NEEL MEHTA: OK.

376
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,959
This one.

377
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:15,750
That's pretty good.

378
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,250
Yes.

379
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,730
On Facebook, I think it
would look a bit like that.

380
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,730
So here's how we go about
adding icons to our pages.

381
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,080
We just have a span-- a span is a
neutral container for something.

382
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,080
A div is a container for something,
a span is another container.

383
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,100
divs have line breaks
around them, spans do not.

384
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,592
So there's different ways of
having generic containers.

385
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:36,550
Like it doesn't make sense to put it
inside of a paragraph or anything.

386
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,560
We've got to put it
inside something though,

387
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,910
so we just put inside of a span.

388
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:46,550
So span class=glyphicon
glyphicon-user" close span.

389
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,710
And we now have the
icon inside the button.

390
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,486
>> So it doesn't look entirely unlike
what you might see on facebook.com.

391
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:59,360
And so it's nice that these can
actually be placed anywhere you want.

392
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,480
In your header bars,
in your list groups.

393
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,110
Whatever.

394
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,050
It doesn't have to be
inside of a button.

395
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,315
So as an example, I can
put the same class here.

396
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,440
"glyphicon glyphicon-user".

397
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,383

398
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,725
And it appears just the same.

399
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:15,850
So these icons-- you can use the span
class="glyphicon glyphicon-whatever".

400
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,570

401
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,170
And that will let you add
icons wherever you want.

402
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,000
And icons are a very important
part of making a website look

403
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,470
professional and well done.

404
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,960
So don't overdo it, but it's
often a good thing to know.

405
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,250
>> Panels, again.

406
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,910
I'll just do this again as a recap
because they're kind of involved.

407
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,390
You'll notice that in
turning your normal HTML

408
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:39,800
site into a Bootstrap-afied
site, you'll have

409
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,139
to add extra structure to the website.

410
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,430
For example, we have extra
divs here just because those

411
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,830
are needed to make a panel.

412
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,739
So just keep that in mind that
you'll have to have extra structure.

413
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:50,780
So "panel panel-default".

414
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,740

415
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Maybe it's panel-header.

416
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:03,265

417
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:04,390
I think it's panel-heading.

418
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:10,680

419
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,180
Yes.

420
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,910
There we go.

421
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,420
So, again, there is our panel.

422
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,090
>> One more thing that we
did not cover yet, tables.

423
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,880
Tables, by default look kind of ugly.

424
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,441
Like this.

425
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:22,440
But tables are, of course,
a very important part

426
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,520
of what you will do in web development.

427
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,156
In Pset7, for example, CS50
Finance, which will come out soon,

428
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:29,280
you'll use a lot of tables.

429
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,060
And a lot of web dev use a lot
of tables to display information,

430
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,320
like stocks, or scores, or whatever.

431
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,890
>> So styling tables is actually very easy.

432
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,190
You add the table class to your table.

433
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:46,834
And, I dare say, it looks pretty nice.

434
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:49,000
You can do extra things,
like "table table-striped".

435
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,240

436
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,980
And you'll see the results here.

437
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,835
You can do table-bordered.

438
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:58,210
There's a lot of options you can.

439
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,960
But basically, adding a
table, the table class,

440
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,920
will make your tables look pretty nice.

441
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,070
So that's a brief rundown of
some of the more important styles

442
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,450
and components you'll
need to use for Bootstrap.

443
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,481
So I think that wraps
up our beautiful part.

444
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:19,230
Any questions right now about how
to make your websites beautiful?

445
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,139
How you can use these
components to your advantage?

446
00:21:24,139 --> 00:21:24,680
Feeling good?

447
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,702
Yes?

448
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:27,410
AUDIENCE: Maybe this
is a silly question,

449
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,160
but can you use Bootstrap on Wikipedia?

450
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,304
If you're editing a Wikipedia page?

451
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:33,970
NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

452
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,630
So the question was, I'm
editing a Wikipedia page,

453
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,360
can I include Bootstrap styles in there?

454
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:38,970
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

455
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:44,020
>> NEEL MEHTA: And so Bootstrap is
basically a big CSS style sheet.

456
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,610
A CSS style sheet just says, whenever
I have this class, attach these styles.

457
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:56,440
So the CSS style sheet for Bootstrap
is going to be something like .btn,

458
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,960
the button class, will get like a
rounded corner border or whatever.

459
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,350
So basically, Bootstrap it just a
bunch of classes and a bunch of styles

460
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,950
specified for those classes.

461
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,030
So as long as you have that CSS,
this list of rules in your page,

462
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,587
you will get the Bootstrap styling.

463
00:22:13,587 --> 00:22:16,670
That is, of course, contingent on
having the Bootstrap styles in your page

464
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,710
to begin with.

465
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,710
>> And so in Wikipedia,
you probably could not

466
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,120
do that because Wikipedia
does not have Bootstrap in it.

467
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,630
But if it did have Bootstrap,
you could probably do that.

468
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,380
And if you wanted, you could
include it, but that might

469
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,260
break the existing layout of the page.

470
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,350
But very good question.

471
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,380
You can use Bootstrap
wherever it is included,

472
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,060
but it's not built in by default.

473
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,980
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

474
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,900
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

475
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,210
Any more questions?

476
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,710
Yes.

477
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,650
So whether you're here or at home,
just remember getboostrap.com-- again,

478
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,755
getboostrap.com-- is your friend.

479
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:52,880
Whenever you're using
Bootstrap, this will give you

480
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,842
instructions about how to get
started, how to use components.

481
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:58,550
There's some cool JavaScript
plug-ins that we won't go over here,

482
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,240
but they're worth checking out as well.

483
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,490
So this is your friend.

484
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:05,230
It's just important to get
used to how to use this.

485
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:10,120
>> So let's chat a bit about
making responsive websites.

486
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,600
So as I said before, people used
their laptops, they use their phones.

487
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,946
And as you might well imagine, this is
a very different screen size than that.

488
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:21,070
And so the same website
that looks good on my phone

489
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,880
is not going to look good,
necessarily, on a computer.

490
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,130
So what you have to do is
make your website adapt.

491
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:30,060
It has to adapt to the various
screen sizes that it's on.

492
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,090
>> It has to say, I know I'm on a
computer, a big laptop, I should expand.

493
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,920
I know I'm on a phone, I should shrink.

494
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,470
And so Bootstrap provides some
very, very useful tools to do this.

495
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,490
So Bootstrap let's you break
a website into 12 columns.

496
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,420
You can make rows and have 12 columns.

497
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,490
And you can partition
those however you want.

498
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:51,860
You can have one, big thing,
which is 12 columns wide.

499
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,980
You can have two things
that are six each.

500
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,817
You can do one thing that's four,
one that's two, or one that's six.

501
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:58,400
You can do three, three, three, three.

502
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,570
You can do whatever
breakdown that you want.

503
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,730
>> So maybe your web page needs to have a
left column that's one third the width.

504
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,250
So that would be four columns
wide and the rest of the page

505
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,690
would be eight columns wide.

506
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,100
So this is an example.

507
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,380
Let's pull up another example.

508
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,290
>> AUDIENCE: Does it always
have to be an even split?

509
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,750
Could it be a seven, five split?

510
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,416
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

511
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,470
It could be seven, five.

512
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,970
Yes.

513
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:24,110
As long as it adds to 12, it's fine.

514
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,270
So let's go back here.

515
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,960
Again, the code that is
here is also available here,

516
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,130
under responsive example.

517
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,840
So I just pulled up some
example responsive code here.

518
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,870
So you do this by using
a thing called row.

519
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,030
Row is just another class.

520
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,920
It's another style you add onto your
divs to make them their own components.

521
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,430
>> So you say, div
class="row" to make a row,

522
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,990
to give yourself 12 columns of space.

523
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,000
And then you put columns inside of that.

524
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,609
So here we col-xs-6.

525
00:24:57,609 --> 00:24:58,650
Don't worry about the xs.

526
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,880
We'll talk about in a sec.

527
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,560
But basically, we have one
thing that is six wide.

528
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,250
We call it left.

529
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,120
And so that's the left box here.

530
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,390
We have one thing that is
six of the 12 columns wide.

531
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,620
And that one is on the right.

532
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,560
>> well just gives makes
your div fill it up gray.

533
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,790
So that's just so we can
see that they're distinct.

534
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,500
And so this the first example.

535
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,870
It's a very simple example of how you
would use your rows and columns here.

536
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,120
You define a row using class="row".

537
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,000
And then you do class="col-xs-6" do
half, "col-xs-6" to do the other half.

538
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,240
Here's a more complicated example.

539
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,320
Let's look at the Tiny,
Huge, The rest one.

540
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,370
>> We can make Tiny two columns wide,
we can make Huge six columns wide,

541
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,800
and The rest four columns wide.

542
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,960
That adds up to 12.

543
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,950
And so these end up spanning
the width of the page.

544
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,030
Again, we have a row outside.

545
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:54,760
Then we have div class="col-xs-2"
and then 6, and then 4.

546
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,190
And that will provide
the structure for us.

547
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,740
And so we can put whatever
the heck we want inside here.

548
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,410
Instead of Tiny, we can put a button.

549
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,701
button class="btn btn-primary".

550
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:11,820

551
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,260
And so notice that our button
doesn't take up all the width,

552
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,080
but at least it's restricted
to that much space.

553
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,770
>> So that's all well and good.

554
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,800
So we can now break up our web
page into chunks, width wise.

555
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,990
We can say we want to have a left
column, and a right column, and so on.

556
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,220
But we haven't gone over
how you make it responsive.

557
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,130
And so Bootstrap let's do that as well.

558
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,000
It has these things called breakpoints.

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,230
So it has a way of knowing whether
you're on a laptop, you're on a tablet,

560
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,730
you're on a phone horizontal,
or you're on a phone vertical.

561
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,180
It knows the screen size.

562
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:50,630
And breaks this into four categories--
large or lg, which is laptops, usually.

563
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,660
md or medium, which is tablets.

564
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,020
sm, small.

565
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,810
Or xs, extra small.

566
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,500
And so when you specify
a column, you say,

567
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,780
it should be six columns wide
on an extra small device.

568
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,645
That's why we did col-xs-6.

569
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:09,020
We're saying that it should
be six of the 12 columns wide

570
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,110
on an extra small device.

571
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:16,570
And if it's anything bigger, we'll just
default to using the extra small size.

572
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,770
If it's anything bigger than
extra small, it'll be six wide.

573
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:25,800
And so we can leverage
these to make of our columns

574
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,470
take up different amount of
columns based on the screen size.

575
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,580
Let's go to this responsive resizing.

576
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,834
So we have our columns.

577
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:36,250
And it says, "col-lg-6 col-xs-12".

578
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,630

579
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,150
So given what you know
so far, what do you

580
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,150
think is going to
happen on a big screen?

581
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,987
Well, it's kind of
given way, but what do

582
00:27:47,987 --> 00:27:49,820
you think it will look
like on a big screen?

583
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,580
And why is that?

584
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:59,990

585
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:03,820
>> AUDIENCE: Is it that
on a big screen, it's

586
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:11,850
going to take only a
portion of the full space?

587
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,220
Like half of it, I guess?

588
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,420
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

589
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,960
>> AUDIENCE: And on smaller
screen, it's going

590
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,544
to take up the whole screen, the 12.

591
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:19,210
NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

592
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:19,710
Right.

593
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,361
So as an example, let's
just look down here.

594
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:22,860
Yes.

595
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,110
So on anything that is lg or
bigger-- so my computer happens

596
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,820
to be lg because it's
pretty wide-- it will make

597
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,820
it side by side because it's col-lg-6.

598
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,870
So because it's on large, it makes it
six columns wide and six columns wide.

599
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:40,977
Let's see what happens if I
make this into a smaller one.

600
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm just going to un-full screen this.

601
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,550
And I'm going to shrink the screen.

602
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:50,590
I'm going to shrink the screen, so it
looks like I am on a smaller device.

603
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,040
So I'm going to shrink it like this.

604
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,880
>> And voila.

605
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,010
It is now stacked
because now we have gone

606
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:59,280
from large to-- this is probably
an extra small screen size.

607
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,460
And so now it says, OK, we're not
in large, we're in extra small land.

608
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,251
So we're going to use
the extra small size.

609
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,320
And we're going to xs-12, xs-12.

610
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,630
So it's going to be stacked.

611
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:11,626
And just notice that there's
a thing called a breakpoint.

612
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:13,500
A breakpoint is where
you made the transition

613
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,060
from extra small to small,
small to large, and so on.

614
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,807
>> So just notice that as I slide this
out, eventually, you'll get to the point

615
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:22,695
where they'll jump to be side by side.

616
00:29:22,695 --> 00:29:28,780

617
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,330
There you go.

618
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,020
So there's the breakpoint right there.

619
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,600

620
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,790
So we can make it even more complicated.

621
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,260
Now we can say, these
things should be four wide.

622
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,010
That is, they should
take up about a third

623
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,530
of the speech on very large devices.

624
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,600
On a medium device, it should take
up half the screen because it's md-6.

625
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,790
On a very small device,
it should take up 12.

626
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,550
And so this looks pretty natural.

627
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:55,180
Let's just try this out for ourselves.

628
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,000
>> So on a big screen, they're four wide.

629
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,090

630
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,450
Shrink it a little bit.

631
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,430
And they are now six wide.

632
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,180
So this is six, six, six.

633
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,900
Shrink it even more and then
they will be totally stacked.

634
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:17,000
So this, for example, makes sense if
you're having cards, like news cards,

635
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,337
for example, where if
it's on a very big screen,

636
00:30:19,337 --> 00:30:22,670
it's OK if you have several side by side
because they would all get enough room.

637
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,620
But they need to have enough room.

638
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,578
So on a smaller screen,
you'd want to give them

639
00:30:25,578 --> 00:30:29,170
more room, proportionally, of the page.

640
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,290
>> So as a real world example,
let's say we have Twitter.

641
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,180
And we have text box, so
you can tweet on the side.

642
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,020
And we have a list of trending
topics on the right side.

643
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,470
So on a big screen, we should
have them be side by side,

644
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,110
so you can see them at a glass.

645
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,960
But on a smaller screen,
we should do 12 and 12,

646
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,315
so that the trending topics
are below the tweet area.

647
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:52,770
Because the tweet area is the
main thing and on a small screen,

648
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,050
the trending topics don't
matter quite as much.

649
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,730
And so we put them right below, so
that they can both get enough space.

650
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,480
Make sense so far?

651
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,470
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

652
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,530
>> NEEL MEHTA: Solid.

653
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,500
So that's all the examples I have here.

654
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,190
Let's try and do a challenge.

655
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:18,560
So again, this is challenge-2.html for
those of you following along at home.

656
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,500
So my buddy, Mark Zuckerberg,
came to me the other day.

657
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,780
And he's like, Neel, I have
gotten pretty good at web design.

658
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,700
I can do the HTML.

659
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,570
I have made this little,
new edit to Facebook.

660
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,930
I have a new idea for how
we should style Facebook.

661
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,700
And here it is.

662
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,200
Right here.

663
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,241
Here's some example code.

664
00:31:34,241 --> 00:31:35,820
So it's called Fancybook.

665
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,340
>> We have some status updates.

666
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,010
We have Nemo, Mike Kosowski,
Woody-- three status updates.

667
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,107
And then we have a list of
online friends right below it.

668
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,190
So he's done his homework.

669
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,814
He knows a little bit about
Bootstrap, he's made the list view,

670
00:31:47,814 --> 00:31:49,870
he has done a little bit of HTML.

671
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,150
So he has the web page.

672
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,450
But he's like, Neel, I don't
understand responsive design at all.

673
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,960
Do you have any experts who
could help me with that?

674
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
And fortunately, you are now
experts in responsive design.

675
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,290
>> So what he told me was that he
wants Fancybook to look like this.

676
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,220
On a very small device,
like a phone, everything

677
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,790
should be stacked, like here.

678
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,240
So you have the timeline
upfront, up top, and then

679
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,370
you should have the
chat bar at the bottom.

680
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,760
But on a tablet or a medium
device, it should be half and half,

681
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,010
as in the timeline should be
half and the list of chat friends

682
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,450
should be on the other half.

683
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,960
>> Then on a laptop, the timeline
should take up three fourths

684
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,120
and then the chat hedge should
take up another one quarter.

685
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,350
And so he's like, Neel, I have this
code here, but it's not responsive.

686
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:38,760
It needs to behave like this.

687
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,390
So my challenge to you
is given this code here--

688
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,030
if you refresh your
CodePens, you'll see this.

689
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,840
Or if you just paste in the code
on challenge-2, you'll see this.

690
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,380
>> Here's this example code.

691
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,450
You'll see some xxxs.

692
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:00,860
I want you to change the xxxs, such that
the timeline and the list of friends

693
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,160
follows these specs here.

694
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,660
Don't worry about what's
inside the timeline for now.

695
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,020
We'll get that in the next step.

696
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,600
But for now, let's see if we get
these things to split it up like this.

697
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,935
So does that make sense?

698
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:14,810
So if you're at home,
pause the video and try

699
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:18,410
to make your web page
look responsive like this.

700
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,530
If you're here, take
like two, three minutes.

701
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,770
Feel free to chat with a neighbor,
and try, and fix Mr. Zuckerberg's

702
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,045
responsive design problem.

703
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:49,604

704
00:33:49,604 --> 00:33:51,770
If you have any questions,
feel free to let me know.

705
00:33:51,770 --> 00:34:15,520

706
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,860
Feeling good?

707
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,610
Done?

708
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,109
Nice.

709
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:19,025
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

710
00:34:19,025 --> 00:34:19,929
NEEL MEHTA: What?

711
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,500
>> AUDIENCE: I'm good.

712
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,379
>> NEEL MEHTA: Oh, good.

713
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:21,879
Nice.

714
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:28,820

715
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,120
AUDIENCE: The thing about
the 12, is it that Bootstrap

716
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:42,150
treats a given screen space as 12
units across and then divides that up?

717
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,500
How exactly does the
proportioning work for this?

718
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:44,750
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

719
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,190
So the question is, how
does the proportioning

720
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,299
work for Bootstrap, right?

721
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:47,882
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

722
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:50,659
NEEL MEHTA: So whenever
you have a div class="row",

723
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,879
no matter how big the screen is,
Bootstrap will give you 12 units

724
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,670
of the same size to
take up that much size.

725
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,830
So in col 1, it's always 8.33%
of the size of the screen,

726
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,010
whether that's this wide
or that's this wide.

727
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,030
And so, of course, on a smaller
screen, each column is smaller.

728
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,360
You still have 12 columns
wide, it's a smaller.

729
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,985
So it's up to you to make sure
that things take up more column,

730
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,960
proportionally, to compensate
for that lack of space.

731
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,944
Does that make sense?

732
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:17,527
>> AUDIENCE: Yes.

733
00:35:17,527 --> 00:35:18,157
Thank you.

734
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,240
NEEL MEHTA: Good question.

735
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:55,318

736
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:57,026
AUDIENCE: On a large
screen, can you have

737
00:35:57,026 --> 00:35:58,622
the timeline take up three fourths?

738
00:35:58,622 --> 00:35:59,288
>> NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

739
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:24,036

740
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:25,410
NEEL MEHTA: How are guys feeling?

741
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,330
Good?

742
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:26,830
Cool.

743
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,621
So let's come back.

744
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:32,740
And let's try and fix this part
of Mr. Zuckerberg's website.

745
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:36,640
So the timelines is up here, at
the top, and the list of friends

746
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,460
is at the bottom.

747
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,530
And so we just need to assign
columns, with sizing proportional,

748
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,820
in each of these.

749
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,280
So this first xxx is for the timeline.

750
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,720
What classes do we put in here?

751
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:53,960

752
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,210
What did you guys put in here?

753
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,477

754
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:03,810
So remember, on a large screen, it needs
to take up three quarters of the width.

755
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,470
And so what style would give you that?

756
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,480
On a large screen, three
quarters of the width.

757
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,680
What class do we use there?

758
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:25,980

759
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,320
AUDIENCE: So we're just going to be
editing that first instance of class.

760
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,153
NEEL MEHTA: For now.

761
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:30,790
Yes.

762
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:36,600
>> AUDIENCE: We're not editing each,
individual feature of the timeline?

763
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,850
NEEL MEHTA: Not now, at least.

764
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,020
So this whole thing is a block.

765
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,180
We're just changing the
designing of the block.

766
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:49,750
So here we do col-lg-9 because it's
nine out of the 12 wide on a big screen.

767
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:55,867
And then on a medium screen,
how many columns should I get?

768
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:57,700
AUDIENCE: It's supposed
to be half and half.

769
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:57,930
NEEL MEHTA: Right.

770
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:58,950
So how many is that?

771
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,658
>> AUDIENCE: So six.

772
00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:00,430
NEEL MEHTA: Six.

773
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:08,970
And then extra small should be-- if it
takes up the entire width of the row,

774
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,169
how many should it be?

775
00:38:10,169 --> 00:38:10,710
AUDIENCE: 12.

776
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,335
NEEL MEHTA: 12.

777
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:12,217
Yes.

778
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:14,050
And now we've got to
change this other ones,

779
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,120
so it takes up the rest of the space.

780
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,314
So col-lg--

781
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:25,409

782
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,450
AUDIENCE: It's going to
take up the whole screen?

783
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,540
NEEL MEHTA: It takes up a quarter
of the screen on a large device,

784
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,290
as we showed here.

785
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,040

786
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,740
>> AUDIENCE: Three.

787
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,490
>> NEEL MEHTA: Three.

788
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,250
And then col-md-6 to take
up the rest of the space.

789
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:39,750
col-xs-12.

790
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,404

791
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,570
So now we have the timeline
taking up three quarters

792
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,610
of the page in the big screen
and then one quarter on the side.

793
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,045
And then if size the screen down,
it should resize accordingly.

794
00:38:54,045 --> 00:38:56,580

795
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:59,070
So it's stacked now,
on a very small screen.

796
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:06,910
And if we size it up a little bit,
they should be exactly half and half.

797
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,500
So we've done that so far.

798
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,236
Very cool.

799
00:39:11,236 --> 00:39:13,360
And so we won't do the
other part of the challenge.

800
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,401
You can do that yourself.

801
00:39:14,401 --> 00:39:18,754
But basically, you have to
try and make these responsive

802
00:39:18,754 --> 00:39:21,170
as well-- make the timeline
items, themselves, responsive.

803
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,584

804
00:39:23,584 --> 00:39:25,500
So now we've gone through
all you need to know

805
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,160
about the responsive side of Bootstrap.

806
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,787
Any questions about responsive
design with Bootstrap

807
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:32,370
and how you might go about doing that?

808
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,811

809
00:39:36,811 --> 00:39:37,310
Yes?

810
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,855
>> AUDIENCE: Is it similar if
we had an embedded video

811
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:43,575
and we wanted to control the
scale at which the video was--

812
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:47,644
the size of the video
going from laptop to phone.

813
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:48,310
NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

814
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:48,870
More or less.

815
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,880
You'd have to tell the video to
take up as much room as it's given,

816
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,600
which is a little annoying sometimes.

817
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,570
But the core idea is the same.

818
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,230
A video, like any other object in
the page, like a button or whatever,

819
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,740
as long as you use the
columns and the rows,

820
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:05,080
you can give it a
certain amount of space.

821
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,580
And so getting it to honor that is a
different question because like YouTube

822
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,780
embeds have a certain, preferred size.

823
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,264
But theoretically at
least, it would work.

824
00:40:14,264 --> 00:40:18,990

825
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,120
Cool?

826
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,750
>> AUDIENCE: I suppose then,
for an image, do you actually

827
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:31,092
need to have different versions of
the same image in different sizes

828
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,864
for laptop versus iPhone?

829
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,030
Yeah The question is, do we need to
have images that are responsive as well.

830
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,040
And indeed, you can do that.

831
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,167
I think it's in CSS.

832
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:44,000
But Bootstrap allows
you to do that as well.

833
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,080
You can have responsive images.

834
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:50,650
You can have your images resize
according to the size of the page.

835
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,360
And there's a very new thing
HTML5, the newest version of HTML,

836
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,210
and CSS3, the newest
version of CSS, which

837
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,091
will let you request different images
based on the screen size you're at.

838
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,090
Usually, it's good enough to just
have your image just shrink or grow to

839
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,215
however big it needs to be.

840
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:08,150
But you can, if you want
to, have one 32 by 32

841
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,040
for very small screens, and
64 by 64 for a big screen,

842
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,910
and then serve those selectively.

843
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,059
You can do it.

844
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:15,100
It's done by some people.

845
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,391
It's still pretty cutting edge.

846
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:21,537
But short answer, responsive images--
Bootstrap can save the day there.

847
00:41:21,537 --> 00:41:22,036
Cool?

848
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:22,920
>> AUDIENCE: Thank you.

849
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,795
>> NEEL MEHTA: So let's
talk real fast about how

850
00:41:24,795 --> 00:41:26,590
to get this in your own web page.

851
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:30,620
Let's say you want make your
own website using Bootstrap.

852
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,675
And so let's just just
walk through it together.

853
00:41:34,675 --> 00:41:37,320
Let's say you make just
a normal HTML page.

854
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:44,410
Feel free to follow along in
whatever your favorite editor is.

855
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,190
So we just have some HTML page.

856
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:54,970

857
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,170
We can do !doctype html.

858
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,310
This is also html, our page.

859
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,840

860
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,340
Nothing new.

861
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,298
We've done this before.

862
00:42:04,298 --> 00:42:08,910

863
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,110
So here we have our HTML and
we can put stuff inside here.

864
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:20,430

865
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,870
We can have our button.

866
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:25,490
And as I said before, this
isn't necessarily going to work.

867
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,560
Why might this not work?

868
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,430
Why won't we get our
nice, colorful button?

869
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:35,260

870
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:40,969
>> AUDIENCE: Because we didn't link it
to the Bootstrap project or the file?

871
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:41,635
NEEL MEHTA: Yes.

872
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:42,135
Correct.

873
00:42:42,135 --> 00:42:44,630
Because Bootstrap-- it's
just a fancy CSS file.

874
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,390
It's a series of styles that
are attached to your elements.

875
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,250
Here we've told it that we
want to use these styles.

876
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,794
I'll size that up a little bit.

877
00:42:52,794 --> 00:42:54,960
We've told it we want use
these styles, but we never

878
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,170
told it what the styles are.

879
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,880
And that's what your
question from earlier was.

880
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,963
That's the answer to that.

881
00:42:58,963 --> 00:43:02,796
We need to find a way to get the styles
and include them in our page somehow.

882
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:04,670
And so Bootstrap will
show us how to do that.

883
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:10,800
>> So if you go to the top
here, Getting Started.

884
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,980
There's different ways to download it.

885
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,560
This might not make sense necessarily.

886
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,180
Bootstrap-- this will let
you grab the CSS file itself.

887
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,950
And you included it in your own page.

888
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,570
Source Code is if you want
to hack on it by yourself.

889
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,740
You don't need this really.

890
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:29,690
Sass is a language
that compiles into CSS.

891
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,160
Think of it as a preprocessor.

892
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,280
Much like PHP is a preprocessor of
HTML, Sass is a preprocessor for CSS.

893
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,930
So if you want to do it
that way, you can do that.

894
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,500
>> The easiest way is using a CDN,
or content delivery network.

895
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,050
It's a website that just
serves up a copy of Bootstrap

896
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,030
very fast for you to
include in your own page.

897
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,160
So here's an example.

898
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,375
It'll give you this link element.

899
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:57,089
A link element tells your browser,
take whatever files are stored here

900
00:43:57,089 --> 00:43:58,380
and include it in our web page.

901
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,290
And in this case, it's
the Bootstrap CSS file.

902
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,210
So we'll just copy that URL, or
that text, and we'll throw it inside

903
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,380
of our head.

904
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,740
>> And I won't start the page for this,
but you can trust that this works.

905
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,650
The link will get you the CSS.

906
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,910
Include it in your
page and then you'll be

907
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:19,420
able to use all of the Bootstrap
classes that you know and love.

908
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,350
If you want to keep it locally and
have it on your own file system

909
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,550
instead of having to go to
the internet to grab it,

910
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,300
like if you want to
use the site offline,

911
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,580
you can use the Download option.

912
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,480
But for the most part, using the
CDN is pretty fast because that way,

913
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,130
it's kept updated for you as well.

914
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:40,060
You have to manually update it either.

915
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:40,900
Make sense?

916
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,240
>> So a lot of tools will have this built
in by default. In your Pset7 and Pset8,

917
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,970
I believe Bootstrap is
automatically included.

918
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,690
And in CodePen, for
example, it's already

919
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,500
included because I
added add that setting.

920
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,520
So if you ever want to play around
with it, you can just go on CodePen,

921
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,020
or go on your ID, or whatever.

922
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,110
And you might be able to
access Bootstrap there,

923
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,750
but it's not always built
in, by default, to the web.

924
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,810
Make sense?

925
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,450
>> Yes.

926
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,120
just as a recap-- we have
like five minutes left.

927
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:11,922
But as a recap, in new web pages,
you can include Bootstrap like this.

928
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:14,630
And once you have it included,
you can do all the fun stuff here.

929
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:19,330
You can go on, and you can just peruse
the CSS, you can add some cool styles,

930
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,830
you can have components
like the buttons,

931
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:25,774
and the tables, and the list
items that we mentioned.

932
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:28,690
There's some cool JavaScript plugins,
which you might want to explore.

933
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,050
They add some cool
interactivity to the web page.

934
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:37,110
Like this one makes a modal dialogue.

935
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,310
>> So there's some fun stuff
you can do with Bootstrap.

936
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,410
So my advice to you is go ahead
and use it in your own projects,

937
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,750
follow the instructions we
just did as to how to get it,

938
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,970
and just read the Bootstrap because
you'll learn more about what to do.

939
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,890
And so we've gone
over, today, how to use

940
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:58,820
the documentation, what the building
blocks are, and how it is conceptually.

941
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,680
So now my challenge to you is
make a website using Bootstrap.

942
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,117
Go into the docs.

943
00:46:05,117 --> 00:46:07,825
And use the tools that we've
learned so far to try and parse them

944
00:46:07,825 --> 00:46:09,060
and understand them.

945
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,230
And use those styles and tools
you see there in your website.

946
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,070
And it's just a big,
experimental process.

947
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,110
>> Try out a certain style.

948
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,651
Does it work?

949
00:46:16,651 --> 00:46:17,380
Does is not?

950
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,630
Try putting stuff together.

951
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,520
See what happens.

952
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,690
It's very much a self
guided, discovery process.

953
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,170
But today, we've learned the
very basics of what is Bootstrap?

954
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,400
Why does it work?

955
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,110
How does it work?

956
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,620

957
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,970
How do we start using
it, in the first place?

958
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:33,720
And so now that you're
over that hump, you

959
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,630
should be able to do it
pretty smoothly by yourself.

960
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,450
>> So once again, all the
code we did is here.

961
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,190
So if you ever want
to get a brush up on,

962
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,640
like, what's a quick cheat
sheet for all of the styles?

963
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,310
You can go into this sample here.

964
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,010
We have some example styles here.

965
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,300
If you want to try the
challenges again by yourself,

966
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,940
you can try them here and
check out the solutions.

967
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,710
So this link will be
included on the slides, which

968
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,280
will be sent out to you of course.

969
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,196
But it's also up here.

970
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:02,460
You can pause the video, if you want.

971
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,302
All the information you need is
going to be right here, on this site.

972
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:09,510
So if anyone has any questions, we can
take them for the next couple minutes.

973
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:12,460
Otherwise, thank you all
very much for watching.

974
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:13,205
