00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:10,710

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,240
>> DAVID J. MALAN: This is CS50.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,250
This is the end of week nine, and we
have so much fun stuff to do today.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:18,350
And in fact, not only are we going
to demonstrate some three dimensional

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,300
technology for you in virtual
reality with a very special guest,

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,880
we're also shooting today's
lecture in virtual reality.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,170
In three dimensions with a camera
here, with a set of cameras here.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,240
And so just so that we can approximate
the experience of having one of you

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,730
come up on stage, could one of
you actually come up on stage?

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,254
Standing in-- let's go right here.

12
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:40,920
I think I saw your hand among the first.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,419
>> Come on up.

14
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:42,880
What's your-- [AUDIO OUT].

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,380
Arianna.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,600
Come on up and-- [AUDIO OUT] What
I'm going to do is you come on up

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,060
is throw onto our screen
over here-- what the headset

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,590
that Colton has ready for you.

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,977
Nice to see you.

20
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:58,810
And if you want to go
ahead and put this on.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,250
Colton, what do we have that Arianna
is going to be putting before her eyes?

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,140
>> COLTON: You're going to be
watching a movie trailer.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,473
>> DAVID J. MALAN: A movie trailer.

24
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,234
And as I recall, this is a
fairly scary movie trailer.

25
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:08,900
ARIANNA: Really?

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,910
DAVID J. MALAN: For at
least one of us in the room.

27
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,640
No one saw that.

28
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,090
All right.

29
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,700
And in a moment it should be
projecting onto Colton's laptop an

30
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,190
in turn the screen here.

31
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,740
Let me go over here to that input,
and here's what Arianna seeing.

32
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,000
So she sees it as one image, whereas
we see it, of course, in two.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,350
Left eye and right eye.

34
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,930
Let me go ahead and I'll
toss it on the overhead too,

35
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,304
even though it's a little bright.

36
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:39,910

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,682
>> In this virtual reality there's a big
play button in the middle of the room.

38
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:44,178
>> COLTON: Make sure it's highlighted.

39
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:45,170
Hit the play button.

40
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,379
>> DAVID J. MALAN: There you go.

41
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,212
>> COLTON: [INAUDIBLE].

42
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:51,175

43
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,800
DAVID J. MALAN: OK, we're hitting Play.

44
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,380
It's very scary.

45
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,200
Very scary movie.

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,060
Here we go.

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,580
All right.

48
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,440
Loading.

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,709
Loading the very scary room.

50
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:05,750
COLTON: So now you should
just be in a dark room.

51
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,080
DAVID J. MALAN: Now
she is in a black room,

52
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,889
which is scary and very realistic.

53
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,940
There we go.

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,440
All right.

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,481
Go ahead and look around.

56
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:24,140

57
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,295
The wi-fi's being a
little slow for us here.

58
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:29,012

59
00:02:29,012 --> 00:02:29,720
Oh, that's scary.

60
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,240
Who's she?

61
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,260

62
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,278
Very scary menu keeps coming up too,

63
00:02:36,278 --> 00:02:39,554
>> [LAUGHTER]

64
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,430

65
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,904
>> Notice that it certainly
figures out where she's going.

66
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:44,570
Time is passing.

67
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,590

68
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,530
Something very creepy.

69
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,130
Oh, my goodness.

70
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,410
Oh, my goodness.

71
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,580
Blood in the shape of the movie's logo.

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,980
And I think if we wait long
enough, Arianna, something

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,710
will start crawling toward you.

74
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,776

75
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,275
You see it yet?

76
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:08,858
ARIANNA: Yeah.

77
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:12,477

78
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:13,560
DAVID J. MALAN: All right.

79
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,720

80
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,320
There we go.

81
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,750
That can't be good.

82
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,380
OK, careful.

83
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,410
Now you're going to-- [INAUDIBLE]
a big round of applause.

84
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,090
Sorry.

85
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,820
>> [LAUGHTER]

86
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,330
>> It's me.

87
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,080
It's me.

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,260
OK, thank you to Arianna for coming up.

89
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,110
>> [APPLAUSE]

90
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,310
>> We'll show you--

91
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,397
>> [APPLAUSE]

92
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:37,730
We'll see if we can share
some of that footage with you.

93
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,734
So let's take a quick look at a couple
of announcements, a couple of examples,

94
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:44,900
and then we'll turn the stage over to
our friend, Professor Peter Manuelian,

95
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,380
who's going to talk to us today
about the use of technology

96
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,590
and the application of computer
science to the world of archaeology

97
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,770
in just a bit.

98
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,740
So first, doughnuts are
available today at 4:00 PM

99
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,790
if you are hungry for that, and
advice about concentrating in or doing

100
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,270
a secondary in computer science.

101
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,990
Maxwell Dworkin is just down
the road at 33 Oxford Street.

102
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,580
Do feel free to join a bunch of
the staff and CS concentrators

103
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,560
and faculty for some tips.

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,450
>> So recall that last time we left
off with a somewhat technical topics

105
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,450
but that syntactically are
pretty easily implemented.

106
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,120
One was an anonymous function, and
the name kind of says what it means.

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,417
But just in relative layman's terms,
what is an anonymous function?

108
00:04:23,417 --> 00:04:26,220
>> [LOUD NOISE]

109
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,110
>> That was scary.

110
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,660
Yes?

111
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,635
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

112
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,510
DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah.

113
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,384
It literally is that.

114
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:32,610
It's a function to which
you don't give a name.

115
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,860
And that seems a little weird because
if it has no name, how do you call it?

116
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,960
How do you call a
function that has no name?

117
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,536
Yeah?

118
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:42,870
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

119
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,370
DAVID J. MALAN: Bind it to an event.

120
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,870
So this is a fancy way of saying you
tell the [? web ?] browser in advance

121
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,180
that when something interesting
happens, call this function.

122
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,730
And in fact, there's another buzz word
for this, which is simply a callback.

123
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,890
So indeed a callback
function is a function

124
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,510
that gets called when some data is
ready or when some event has happened.

125
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,710
And so in particular,
when we did something

126
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,890
like an [? oncommit ?]
handler or an onclick handler,

127
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,447
you might actually want some function
to get called when that event happens.

128
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,530
And it doesn't matter what
its name so long as you

129
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,700
told the browser in advance
what function to call

130
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,440
and how that code should look,
which we'll see again in a moment.

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,690
>> And we'll also now take a
look at one other topic, Ajax,

132
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,770
which once upon a time stood for
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML

133
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,720
but now it stands for really just a more
general technology or technique whereby

134
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,220
a browser, by way of JavaScript,
can request more data from a server

135
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,490
even after the web page
has initially loaded.

136
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,350
So you're not using Ajax in pset seven.

137
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,220
Every time you click a button
or hit Enter or fill out a form

138
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,220
and then send it to the server,
the whole page is refreshing,

139
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,100
the URL is probably changing, and
some dynamic output is happening.

140
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,630
In problem set eight we'll use
JavaScript and a bit of Ajax

141
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,420
as well so that things happen much more
seamlessly and a lot less deliberately

142
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,220
step by step by step.

143
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,530
>> But first, let's take
a look at JavaScript

144
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,031
by way of this super simple example.

145
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,613
This is just a web page where
I've got a big div in the middle

146
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,330
of the page and really big text.

147
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,190
And with what language did I
probably make the text really big?

148
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,830
HTML, but in CSS.

149
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,610
CSS properties allow me
to specify really big.

150
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,170
I could specify colors or
any number of other things.

151
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,970
>> But back in the day--
actually, around the time I

152
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,580
was making those terrific personal
websites I showed you on Monday--

153
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,980
there was actually an HTML tag called
the blink tag, whose purpose in life

154
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,090
was to do exactly that.

155
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,440
If you do open tag blink,
some text, close tag blink,

156
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,390
the text would just blink on the screen.

157
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,661
So web pages in the
'90s did a lot of this.

158
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,160
Literally.

159
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,210
>> Worse yet, there was a marquise
tag whereby your text would just

160
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,980
scroll across the screen As though
that was a good idea as well.

161
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,840
So amazingly, one of the few things that
browser manufacturers like Microsoft

162
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,130
and Mozilla and Google
have actually agreed on

163
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,320
is to kill off tags like that.

164
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,630
So they don't then exist any longer,
but if we're really insistent

165
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,930
we could probably re-implement this.

166
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,111
>> So let me show you the bottom of
a file here called blink.html.

167
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:05,110
And there's obviously some HTML here,
and it's a pretty simple web page.

168
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,710
Indeed, there's that div I mentioned.

169
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,700
I've given it a unique identifier so
that either in CSS or in JavaScript

170
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,100
I can uniquely refer to it so that I'm
not confusing it with any other divs

171
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,660
if there were actually any.

172
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,560
And now notice at the top I've got
a style tag in the head of the page,

173
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,540
though I could certainly factor that
out and put it in a styles.css file

174
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,590
as you have in pset seven.

175
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,110
>> And this just why it's big.

176
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,510
It's 96 point, it's got a big margin
around it which pushes it down

177
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,770
toward the middle, and
it's aligned in the center.

178
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,441
But now, I've also got
a script tag up top.

179
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:37,190
And even though some
of the syntax is new,

180
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,350
let's take a look at how we
could re-implement this atrocity

181
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,011
from years past known as the blink tag.

182
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:45,760
So here's a function,
and I have named it.

183
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,450
So it's not an anonymous
function in this case,

184
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,699
but it does have a name blank.

185
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:49,770
Takes no arguments.

186
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,590
Now this first line here is
the first interesting one.

187
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,700
And what is this return to me?

188
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,600
On the left hand side it gives
me a variable called div,

189
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,209
and what is that div ultimately?

190
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:02,750
How would you describe this to
a somewhat technical roommate?

191
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,083
What is that line of code doing?

192
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,140

193
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,460
What's that line of code doing?

194
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,829

195
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,870
So it declares a variable
on the left called div,

196
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,871
and then what is the right hand
side of the expression return?

197
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,370
What's a good way to think about it?

198
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,702

199
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:21,660
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

200
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,095
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Say again?

201
00:08:22,095 --> 00:08:23,420
>> AUDIENCE: The value stored in greeting.

202
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,295
>> DAVID J. MALAN: The
value stored in greeting.

203
00:08:25,295 --> 00:08:26,060
Not quite.

204
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,610
So if you think of the HTML
page as a tree in memory,

205
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,770
the so-called dom or
document object model

206
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,740
whereby you just have a whole bunch--
like a family tree draped down

207
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,110
from some root node.

208
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,360
The element that has an ID is
literally referring to the HTML element

209
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,210
down here that has an ID of greeting.

210
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,520
So if you think of this div tag
as being a node in a tree, what

211
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,210
get element by ID is doing quite
simply is returning to you,

212
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,230
if we were using C, a pointer
to that node in the tree.

213
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,469
A pointer to that node
in your data structure.

214
00:08:57,469 --> 00:08:58,760
We don't have pointers anymore.

215
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,230
Now we just think of things more
higher level, like variables,

216
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,210
but stored in div right now with
some kind of reference or pointer

217
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,432
to that node in the tree.

218
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:08,390
Now this is interesting
because that's the node

219
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,910
that we want to make blink on or off.

220
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,030
On or off.

221
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,670
And we have a technique for
changing the style of a tag,

222
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,380
of course, which is CSS.

223
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,530
And what's nice today is
that we see that there's

224
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,100
this bridge between
JavaScript and CSS whereby

225
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,560
you can use JavaScript to change the
CSS properties of existing elements.

226
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,960
You don't have to hard code
all of your CSS in advance.

227
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,860
You can actually dynamically change
the aesthetics of your page as follows.

228
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,710
>> Notice here, and you might not have
ever seen this property before,

229
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,890
but it turns out in CSS there's
a property called visibility.

230
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,860
And for reasons that have never been
clear to me, the opposite of hidden

231
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,300
is visible and the
opposite of visible is

232
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,200
hidden, as opposed to it
being invisible but so be it.

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,270
But what I'm doing here is I'm checking.

234
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,160
If div.style.visibility-- so we've
seen this dot notation a lot,

235
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,530
and it's common in JavaScript because
objects like these nodes that we're

236
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,350
talking about have properties.

237
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,780
And those properties might
have properties inside of them.

238
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,200
So relate it to data.

239
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,299
>> So if that div style has a visibility
property that equals hidden,

240
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:10,590
what do I want to do if I
want to make this thing blink

241
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,127
and that div is currently hidden?

242
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:14,210
I want to make it visible.

243
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:19,380
Else, if it's not hidden-- ergo it's
visible-- I want to make it hidden.

244
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,230
So these six or so lines of code
here-- eight lines of code--

245
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,480
simply have the effect of making
something hidden or visible.

246
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,760
Hidden or visible.

247
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,635
Hidden or visible.

248
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:29,760
But just once because
there's no kind of loop here,

249
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,270
so it doesn't feel like
it's blinking quite yet.

250
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,850
>> But down here, notice
I've got this line.

251
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:39,810
It turns out that built into browsers,
and JavaScript specifically, there

252
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,375
is a global variable called window.

253
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,250
And we've seen another
global variable called

254
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,791
document, which we used a moment ago.

255
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,290
There's another one called
window that generally refers not

256
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,550
to the contents of the page but just
the general idea of the whole browser

257
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,220
window.

258
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,700
And window.setInterval, you can
kind of guess what this means.

259
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,990
It's going to do something maybe
cyclically every some number

260
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,310
of milliseconds apparently,
according to my comment?

261
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,437
>> So in English I'm saying,
blink every 500 milliseconds.

262
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:06,270
But a little more technically, what
is this highlighted line of code

263
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,130
telling the browser to do?

264
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,560
It's making it blink, but why?

265
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,570
What's it doing technically?

266
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,350
Yeah?

267
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,222
No?

268
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:15,430
[? Put that instead. ?] Yeah?

269
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,241
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

270
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,240
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.

271
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,695
It's calling a function every 500
milliseconds, or half a second,

272
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,229
and that function is called blink.

273
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:26,270
And so recall on Monday that we said
that just like variables, functions,

274
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,750
because they have names or
symbols associated with them,

275
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,420
you can pass those around just
like their pieces of data as well.

276
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,130
So here we're just saying,
hey, browser window.

277
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,320
Set the following interval.

278
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,137
Every 500 milliseconds
call that function.

279
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:40,720
And the browser doesn't even
have to care what the function is

280
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,800
so long as it's defined somewhere.

281
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,530
>> So the net effect, if I go ahead and
save this and go back to this page

282
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,450
and reload now that I've
enabled that function,

283
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,910
is that this is literally what a lot
of websites looked like in the 1990s.

284
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,640
You reach here.

285
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,330
Hello.

286
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,350
Welcome to my creepy web page,
as I recall, it was on Monday.

287
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,940
So the goal here is not to
re-implement the blink tag

288
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,690
but to show this convergence between
JavaScript, a language, and CSS,

289
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,922
this sort of stylization.

290
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:08,130
But now let's do something
a little more interesting.

291
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,660
>> In problem set seven,
you have already been

292
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,340
or will soon be implementing a quote
page, whereby you can type in a stock

293
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,714
symbol, hit Submit, and
then the page reloads

294
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:20,630
and you see a share of Google costs
such and such dollars or something

295
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,330
like that.

296
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,460
And that's not Ajax.

297
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,210
That's just HTTP.

298
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,210
A form submits from one page to
another, and you get back a response.

299
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,610
But what if I wanted a
slightly more elegant approach?

300
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,660
Let me go ahead and type in
goog and click Get Quote.

301
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,050
Now, this is not the prettiest
user interface to be sure,

302
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,890
but notice that just like on
Monday, I got this pop up.

303
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,200
But the contents of that pop
up, though wordy, tell me

304
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,010
that the price is apparently $731.37.

305
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,650
Not all that elegant, but let's
see a slightly better example.

306
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,230
>> Let me now go to version
one of this, if I may.

307
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,810
Version one looks like this.

308
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,180
Same very ugly form.

309
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,650
But if I type in goog
here-- so similarly,

310
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,260
it's just giving me this prompt.

311
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,879
But we can make it even prettier.

312
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,420
So this is a little more interesting.

313
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,490
I clearly didn't put all that
much effort into the aesthetics,

314
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,400
but this is much more akin now to what
Gmail would do or Facebook would do.

315
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,840
You don't get some stupid pop up.

316
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,730
Instead, the contents of the
existing page change like that.

317
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,790
>> So what's going on?

318
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,470
If I go ahead and reload this page,
the contents go back to the default

319
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,760
and I can do something like
FB for Facebook, Get Quote,

320
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,100
and it looks that up as well.

321
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,240
So what's going on?

322
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,640
Well, let me go into Ajax0.html
and first look at the HTML part.

323
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,099
So notice, like Monday, I'm using
the on submit handler, or on submit

324
00:13:40,099 --> 00:13:42,390
event handler, but we've seen
other ways of doing this.

325
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,223
So we're just keeping
things simple for now.

326
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,490
And on submit is telling me, call
the quote function then return false.

327
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,490
And just a sanity check.

328
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,330
Why return false?

329
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,954
What does that prevent?

330
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:51,454
Yeah?

331
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:52,430
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

332
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,580
>> DAVID J. MALAN: The whole
page from reloading,

333
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,160
which would put us back into pset
seven territory, which is not the goal.

334
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,260
We're trying to make things a little
better, a little more seamless

335
00:13:59,260 --> 00:13:59,990
for the user.

336
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,190
So now I just have HTML,
and it's kind of long.

337
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,040
It wraps over the edge
of the screen there,

338
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,050
but I've got an input whose type,
if I keep scrolling, is text.

339
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,077
But what's important is that
it has a unique ID of symbol,

340
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:11,410
and then I have a Submit button.

341
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,050
So this is the very first version.

342
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,880
>> But if I now scroll up-- let's
take a look at the quote function.

343
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,480
It's kind of neat that now, if
you understand or are reasonably

344
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,250
comfortable with HTTP
from pset six or prior,

345
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,790
all that we need to
do really intuitively

346
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,550
is create a URL that contains
the symbol we want to look up.

347
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,260
>> So it turns out that
I wrote in advance--

348
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,426
and we won't look at the code for this,
but I wrote in advance a file called

349
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,490
quote.php that works as follows.

350
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,660
Let me go back into my file directory.

351
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,800
It's not going to work if I just click
on it, but if I go up to my URL here

352
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,200
and go to quote.php and I do
question mark symbol equals goog

353
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,660
and then hit Enter, notice
that I get just this back.

354
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,110
It's not a web page.

355
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,902
It's just text.

356
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:00,110
But it's text that's formatted
in an interesting way.

357
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,650
What format is this text, if you recall?

358
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,300
JSON.

359
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,837
JavaScript Object Notation.

360
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:07,670
And so it's just a bunch
of key value pairs.

361
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,711
It's a little hard to read
when it's a long line,

362
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:12,710
but I see a bunch of quotes
and colons and curly braces,

363
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,960
and that's just the general structure
of associating one piece of data

364
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,300
with one particular value.

365
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:25,070
>> So if I now have a file called quote.php
that clearly, much like pset six,

366
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,370
supports very simple HTTP get
requests, what if in JavaScript I

367
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,110
use my budding skills
with this new language,

368
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,920
construct a URL that
looks exactly like that,

369
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,100
and behind the scenes send
a request from my browser

370
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,500
to the server to get that JSON data?

371
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,370
And that's exactly what we do here.

372
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,820
>> So here's my quote function.

373
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,700
I'm declaring a variable called URL.

374
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,770
On the right hand side
I'm using single quotes,

375
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,820
but you could use double quotes as well.

376
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,420
Notice I'm doing quote, unquote--
that's no pun intended--

377
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,550
quote.php?symbol equals.

378
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,092
And then, even if you're not
quite familiar with this syntax,

379
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:03,799
and indeed most of
you wouldn't be-- this

380
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,650
is using that special
library called jQuery

381
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,030
that you'll see more
on in online resources,

382
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,070
perhaps in the final project.

383
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,190
What am I concatenating onto question
mark symbol equals apparently?

384
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,210
Just generally speaking.

385
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,880

386
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,770
>> AUDIENCE: The symbol.

387
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,280
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, the symbol.

388
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,300
Whatever the human typed into the form.

389
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,600
That is apparently the code in
JavaScript for going into my HTML page,

390
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,130
finding whatever element, whatever
tag, has a unique ID of symbol,

391
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,910
and this hashtag in HTML
just means the unique ID.

392
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,370
So whatever element has a unique
ID of symbol that means go get it.

393
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,150
And .val is a jQuery
function, it turns out,

394
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,340
that just says give me
the value of that field.

395
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,210
>> And then finally, and the
syntax is a little funky--

396
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,770
so it turns out that jQuery, this
library to which I keep referring,

397
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,550
literally has a special
global variable called jQuery.

398
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,580
But it turns out in JavaScript,
somewhat confusingly,

399
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,210
the dollar sign is not a special symbol,
whereas in PHP it's a special symbol.

400
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,960
If you have something with a dollar
sign it means it's a variable.

401
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,082
In JavaScript, a dollar sign
is just like A, B, C, or Z.

402
00:17:04,082 --> 00:17:06,790
It's just a letter of the alphabet
that you can use in variables.

403
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,706
So the people who invented
jQuery just thought

404
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:12,650
it would be kind of cool to lay claim
to a global variable called dollar sign,

405
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:15,040
but it just is an alias for jQuery.

406
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,050
>> So $.getJSON is calling a function
that comes with this popular library,

407
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,130
whose purpose in life is to go get
JSON data, issue an HTTP request,

408
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,460
and get back the response.

409
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,910
The first argument is apparently the URL
from which you want to get that data,

410
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,870
and the second argument, just to tie
things together, is apparently what?

411
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,740
Generally speaking?

412
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,420

413
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,262
What kind of function
is this, if you will?

414
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:41,450
Yeah, an anonymous function
because there's no name.

415
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,130
And using another piece of jargon
from today, it's also a call back.

416
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,150
>> And the purpose here is
that the web can be slow,

417
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,120
and just because you ask
JavaScript and the browser

418
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,770
to go get you some data
from a website via HTTP get,

419
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,730
it could take half a second,
it could take five seconds

420
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,560
if your internet
connection is really slow.

421
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,710
And you don't want the
whole web page to just hang

422
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,890
and some stupid spinning
beach ball to come up,

423
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,710
blocking the user from doing
absolutely everything else.

424
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,200
>> And so the way JavaScript works is
that it's generally asynchronous,

425
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,890
whereby you can do
multiple things at a time

426
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,020
so long as you tell the
browser, hey, browser, when

427
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,070
you are done getting this JSON data.

428
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:23,210
Even if it takes five
seconds, call this function.

429
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,410
Don't make the user wait.

430
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,480
Don't hang the browser
until this happens.

431
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,490
Rather, call me back,
almost like a phone call,

432
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,909
when you're ready and
have the data for me.

433
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,200
Now what does that function do?

434
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,450
It's super trivial.

435
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,450
All it does is it displays
the data that comes back,

436
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,660
and specifically the price
field inside of an alert.

437
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,340
That's all.

438
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,410
And so that's why, to be clear,
when we go to this example, which

439
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:52,950
was [? Ajax0 ?] and I typed in goog and
hit Enter, I got this simple, simple

440
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,672
little prompt.

441
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:55,380
Now it turns out we
can make this better.

442
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,400
And our final example here changes
the quote function as follows.

443
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,990
It's almost identical, but this
was that new and fancy version

444
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,160
whereby I had a placeholder.

445
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,450
This was version two.

446
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,460
And instead of just printing
some silly prompt like that,

447
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,430
I instead changed my actual web page.

448
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,179
And to be clear, let me go
into Chrome's Inspector.

449
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:16,595
Let me go down to the bottom here.

450
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:20,210
And notice, if I zoom in on this bottom
part, this is the HTML of the page

451
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,020
currently.

452
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,870
And notice that right now I've
got a span, which is like a div

453
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,850
but it's a thinner div, if you will.

454
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,070
A span whose ID is priced that
literally says, to be determined.

455
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,390
>> If I go into this form, type
FB, and click Get Quotes,

456
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,290
watch the bottom of the page.

457
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,081
The actual HTML of the page changes.

458
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:40,080
So this is like when you get a Facebook
message and it suddenly pops up,

459
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,824
or a new Gmail row in your inbox.

460
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:43,240
That's literally what's happening.

461
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,100
Someone wrote JavaScript
code at Facebook or Google

462
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,460
that actually changes the web
page that you have already

463
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,740
downloaded to reflect that new content.

464
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,320
>> And if you really want to be fancy and
understand this, noticed what happened.

465
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,660
Let me reload again
and clear all of this.

466
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,900
And now notice I'm on
Chrome's Network tab.

467
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,380
If I do FB here and click Get
Quote, notice just ala pset six,

468
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,400
you can see the HTTP request, and
you can see that my browser requested

469
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,860
quote.php?symbol equals something.

470
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,300
And then if I scroll down here,
if you really want to geek out,

471
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,657
you can see all of the HTTP headers that
my server, Cloud 9, has returned to me.

472
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:24,240
It's more headers than you guys
were spitting out for pset six

473
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
because we kept it simple, but in
there is a whole bunch of information,

474
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,790
among which is that 200 OK message.

475
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,580
And below that's going to be the JSON.

476
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,470
And so all we needed to do to make this
happen is tweak my quote function ever

477
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,450
so slightly.

478
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:42,470
>> Instead of calling the pretty lame
alert function, I simply do this.

479
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,777
Which admittedly, syntactically it
looks frightening at first glance

480
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,610
because there's so much
new syntax going on.

481
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,943
But the ideas are pretty simple.

482
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:52,900
This means, hey, browser, go
call the special jQuery function

483
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,880
that returns to me a pointer to or
a reference to the node in my tree

484
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,390
whose unique identifier is price.

485
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,660
That's that placeholder.

486
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,430
Then it turns out that jQuery comes
with a special function called .html,

487
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,860
whereby if you want to update the
contents of a node in your tree,

488
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,340
you literally just grab that
node, you call the HTML function,

489
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,430
and you hand it whatever you want.

490
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,200
>> So if I wanted to be
sort of silly here I

491
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:23,140
could do something like ha ha, nothing
here, save it, go back over here,

492
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,340
and now if I click Get Quote up top
left, you just get something-- whoops.

493
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,980
If I reload the page
and search for Facebook,

494
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,200
you get something stupid like that.

495
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,100
But I'm dynamically changing
the content [INAUDIBLE].

496
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,396
Any questions?

497
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,580
>> SPEAKER 1: Stop touching your mic.

498
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,370
>> DAVID J. MALAN: The team
is telling me to stop

499
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,460
touching my mic which keeps
falling out of my ear,

500
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,630
so it's just as well that
we're out of material here

501
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,421
and we have time now
for our special guest.

502
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:47,990
Yes?

503
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:51,371
>> AUDIENCE: If there's an opportunity
to change the actual HTML of the page,

504
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,200
does that make it
vulnerable to an exploit?

505
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
DAVID J. MALAN: If there's
not-- say that again?

506
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,566
AUDIENCE: Since there's an opportunity
to change the actual HTML of the page,

507
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:00,040
does it make it
vulnerable to an exploit?

508
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,570
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, yes.

509
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,778
So because you are able to
change the HTML of a page,

510
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:04,760
is it vulnerable
potentially to an exploit?

511
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,600
Potentially yes.

512
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,240
If you're not sanitizing your inputs
or [? scaping ?] them in the right way,

513
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,250
absolutely could you end up triggering
theft of cookies, which is actually

514
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,500
a good segue to what we'll
be talking about on Monday,

515
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,730
which is security topics.

516
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,313
And indeed, that's going to be
one of the exploits we discuss.

517
00:22:19,313 --> 00:22:21,580
Tricking a browser into
injecting something malicious

518
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,120
into its source code.

519
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,160
Any other questions?

520
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,740
>> All right.

521
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,970
Well, I'm so excited today.

522
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,760
So I did my PhD in
computer science, but about

523
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,060
halfway through my degree
in computer science

524
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,350
my eye started wondering
academically and so I

525
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:38,850
started taking-- I think as an auditor
or non-credit status-- anthropology

526
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,400
1010.

527
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,390
It was me the grad student and a whole
bunch of freshman and sophomores here.

528
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,350
But it was amazing class
ever, and to this day

529
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,830
I continue to subscribe to archaeology
magazine, which comes once a month,

530
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,935
and sort of introduces me to what's
going on in the world of yesteryear.

531
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:54,035
>> And we're so happy today to have our
friend, Professor Peter Manuelian,

532
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:57,160
to talk to us about the convergence of
computer science and the application

533
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,340
thereof to this amazing
field of archaeology.

534
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,078
Professor Manuelian.

535
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:05,910
>> [APPLAUSE]

536
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,772
>> PETER MANUELIAN: Thank you, sir.

537
00:23:07,772 --> 00:23:09,980
Great privilege to be on
this stage with the maestro.

538
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,979
Thanks so much for having me here today.

539
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:15,020
I'm going to try to show a little bit
of a real world application of some

540
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,561
of the skills that you've already
been amassing this semester

541
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:20,470
and to try to get you excited
about the human past as well.

542
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,220
So we're going to go
to my favorite place,

543
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,580
outside of Harvard Square, of course,
which is the Giza Pyramids, just

544
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,050
west of modern Cairo.

545
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:31,245
And if you're wondering what BCE
stands for, it's before computer era.

546
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:32,640
>> [LAUGHTER]

547
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,900
>> So three pyramids built by three
famous pharaohs of Egypt's Old Kingdom

548
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,870
or fourth dynasty.

549
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,480
Think about 2,500 or so.

550
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,200
But what's all around them are
hundreds and hundreds of tombs as well.

551
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
So think of Giza as
two amazing data sets.

552
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
One data set is what's still there.

553
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,260
These incredible tombs
surrounding the pyramids that

554
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,980
have these amazing decorations inside.

555
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,430
There are statues, they
are inscriptions-- frozen

556
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,400
moments, if you will, of just about
every aspect of life in ancient Egypt.

557
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,170
So anything you want to study come here.

558
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,630
It's not just a cemetery
full of dead people.

559
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,640
It's a document on how the Egyptians
lived, and as well as how they died.

560
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,600
So that's the data set out at the site.

561
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,252
>> The other one, of course, is
everything that came from Giza.

562
00:24:12,252 --> 00:24:14,210
Things you'll see in the
Peabody Museum, things

563
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,110
you'll see in the Museum of Fine
Arts, and in museums and collections

564
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,150
all over the world.

565
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,140
It's mummies, it's statues,
it's steely, it's jewelry,

566
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,610
it's objects of daily life.

567
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,850
All kinds of cool stuff.

568
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,880
>> So what makes this place so special is
that right here at Harvard University

569
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,100
this is the major excavation that
worked at the site of the Giza Pyramids.

570
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,170
And this is the guy who did it,
my predecessor George Reisner.

571
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,770
1867 to 1942.

572
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,320
Died at the pyramids in the
middle of the Second World War.

573
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,445
And if you're wondering
where this photo was taken,

574
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:46,370
this class photograph, at the end of
class leave by that door, go out there,

575
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,200
and yes, you'll see right
outside this theater,

576
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,030
right against the wall-- that's where
class photos were taken in that day.

577
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,310
>> So an amazing individual, one of the
greatest archaeologists of his time,

578
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,280
way ahead of his time in many ways,
and this is what's called Harvard Camp.

579
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,050
It was a collection of simple mud
brick huts to the west of the pyramids.

580
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,660
And in the courtyard at any particular
day you would see amazing things,

581
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,310
and people came to discuss with the
master about all sorts of topics.

582
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,120
Here are pieces of giant statues.

583
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,350
You can see those in the
Museum of Fine Arts today.

584
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,602
And down below is our computer
model of Harvard Camp.

585
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,810
That's something you might
want to get involved with.

586
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,440
If you're searching for a final project,
some kind of simulation or website

587
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,890
introduction to Harvard
Camp, the dig site.

588
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,580
>> By the time George Reisner was done,
the Harvard University Boston Museum

589
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,000
of Fine Arts expedition
worked at 23 different sites.

590
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,810
All the ones that you see in red here.

591
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,519
So 40 years, 23 sites.

592
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,060
He only came back here to teach
about three or four semesters

593
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,460
over that whole time, so you know
what he enjoyed doing the most.

594
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,540
>> What happens with the massive
archaeological backlog

595
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,240
that a responsible expedition produces?

596
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,280
So 45,000 glass plate
dig photos, diaries,

597
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,970
register books, maps, plans,
small drawings, big drawings,

598
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:03,120
thousands of pages of manuscripts--
some published books, some unpublished.

599
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,780
All this stuff.

600
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,910
And this is where the computer and the
databases and the websites come in.

601
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,550
How do you organize all of this?

602
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:12,200
Try to get a travel grant to Boston and
in a couple of days study this stuff.

603
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,950
You will be overwhelmed.

604
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,580
>> So this is a project that
I started way back in 2000,

605
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,220
and the team here at Harvard
has been working on it ever

606
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,890
since the last several years.

607
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,940
First at the MFA, the
museum, and now at Harvard.

608
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,340
What we had to do is look at
Giza as one big Manhattan.

609
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,410
One gridded site.

610
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,410
And thanks to Reisner,
he numbered all the tombs

611
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,150
in a wonderfully systematic manner.

612
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,240
So we're looking from the air
down at the three pyramids here,

613
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,710
and we realize that it's not even enough
just to master this one expedition.

614
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,700
The areas you see in red are
the Harvard expedition sites,

615
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,570
but the German Austrian
expedition worked

616
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,850
there-- those are the blue areas--
and the Egyptians dug as well.

617
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,900
>> So holistically, trying to understand
an ancient site in all of its functions

618
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,790
and all of its
chronological development,

619
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,490
you've got to take the whole place.

620
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,230
So that sent me on a worldwide tour
with all the colleagues in Egyptology

621
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,030
and the museums at all
these places and gathering

622
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,240
all of their diaries, their photographs,
their documents, their notes--

623
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,540
gathering it at all here
electronically at Harvard.

624
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,530
And the next step is.

625
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,000
How do we put this all together?

626
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,250
>> This is sort of our site
map, and right in the middle

627
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,980
is an individual tomb known
in Arabic as a [? mastaba, ?]

628
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,760
this sort of bench like shape.

629
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,510
And so for every tomb, you've got
x number of this type of data.

630
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,830
So many old photographs, so many objects
registered in the register books.

631
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,080
Diary entries that mention that tomb.

632
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,310
Objects found, drawings
made, plans and sections,

633
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,740
published books on published books,
and more recently, visualization.

634
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,220
3D computer models.

635
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,510
>> And there's just a
sample of an aggregation

636
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,441
of a search for a particular monument.

637
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:44,940
You see all the different things
that are gathered together.

638
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,530
1,012 finds, 45 diary pages that
mention this particular temple.

639
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,090
Ancient people, modern people,
publications, the whole bit.

640
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,990
Downloadable PDFs all gathered
together from a SQL database.

641
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,600
Why is this important?

642
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,530
Just take the comparison of
these two images then and now.

643
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,410
This is happening at Giza, this
is happening all over Egypt,

644
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,880
and more dramatically, happening
all over the Middle East.

645
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,570
And sometimes not by accident,
not the elements of time,

646
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,295
but obviously intentional damage.

647
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:14,990

648
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,522
>> Let me ask you, which
of these two things

649
00:28:17,522 --> 00:28:19,730
you're going to be able to
read in a couple of years?

650
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,090

651
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,510
Which one of these will survive?

652
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:29,157
Which one will have a device that can
access it in a couple of years time?

653
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:31,240
So I think the Egyptians
got something right here.

654
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,370
Put it on stone.

655
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,360
We can still translate
the hieroglyphs there.

656
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,276
I'll bet you anything
this hard drive is going

657
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:37,930
to fail sometime in the near future.

658
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,324
So maybe they understood
something that we didn't.

659
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:43,090
So that's why we've got
to preserve this stuff.

660
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,210
>> And from all the databases,
all the aggregations

661
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,290
and the websites and things, the natural
next step, of course, is visualization.

662
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,820
Put you at the site.

663
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,930
Give you access in 3D to some of these
tombs and temples that you might not

664
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,150
be able to see otherwise.

665
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,730
It's a research tool, it's a
teaching tool, it's edutourism,

666
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,140
it's even edutainment.

667
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,450
And a lot of this goes back
to the really simple stuff.

668
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,605
You see that old, wooden stereo
viewer in 3D photography?

669
00:29:06,605 --> 00:29:08,480
Just what we were seeing
a little bit before.

670
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,780
It's the same principle, right?

671
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,530
We're just putting it
together with things

672
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,310
like GoPro cameras over here and
Gear VR and Oculus Rift headsets,

673
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,520
and anything is possible now.

674
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,870
>> So we're moving from teaching in special
customized classrooms-- visualization

675
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,700
center labs.

676
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,039
We have one above the
Geological Lecture Hall.

677
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,830
Now we're trying to
bring it to the people.

678
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,190
Get it into these headsets.

679
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,700
So imagine all of you or
everyone watching live

680
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,910
or everyone in HarvardX
donning one of these headsets

681
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:36,800
and we're all standing together
in front of the Sphinx,

682
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,010
listening to someone like
me drone on all about it.

683
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:44,899
And we're all there in real time
able to look around in 360 degrees.

684
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:46,190
You can kill the audio on that.

685
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,230
We don't need it on the model.

686
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,670
I'm going to show you how we can go from
visualization and a visualized world

687
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,870
to a real physical world too.

688
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,260
This is a find that George
Reisner made at Giza right

689
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,830
beside the Great Pyramid in 1925.

690
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,980
And way down at the bottom
of 100 foot deep burial shaft

691
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,490
there was an unfinished room with
millions of bits of tiny fragments.

692
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,640
All the wood had decayed.

693
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,800
It was a real mass.

694
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,520
So the photos you're seeing show
the original condition of that tomb,

695
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,980
and now we're going into
our 3D computer model.

696
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,150
And we're able, thanks to
meticulous documentation,

697
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,280
to put that whole tomb's
contents together.

698
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,120
>> And you see all this furniture-- that
curtain box and chairs and tables.

699
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,570
I want you to focus on that chair
that has the falcon arms there.

700
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,670
So this material was actually
reconstructed in modern wood,

701
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,060
and it's on display in
the Cairo Museum and used

702
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,310
to be on display in the Boston MFA,
although they've taken it off view

703
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,420
to use that gallery for something else.

704
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,910
Nobody, however, has
been able to reconstruct

705
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,072
that fancy chair with the falcon arms.

706
00:30:42,072 --> 00:30:44,155
Thanks to this computer
model and this simulation,

707
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:46,350
though, we can actually
start to do that.

708
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,300
>> So in the upper left you
see the reproductions

709
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,730
of some of that furniture.

710
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,380
And it turns out to belong to a queen.

711
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,940
Not any queen, but the mother of the
king who built the Great Pyramid--

712
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,510
Queen Hetepheres.

713
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,770
Big, mysterious burial.

714
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,430
All this stuff deteriorated.

715
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,590
What do we make of it?

716
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,510
But we were able to
take our computer model

717
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,780
and reproduce this chair with
the beautiful falcon arms.

718
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,350
So now you're seeing this
rotating 3D of the model.

719
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,920
Then we decided to go to the real world.

720
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,900
>> We looked at photographs of all
the teensy, tinsy fragments.

721
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,530
The gold, the gilding, the [INAUDIBLE]
inlay tiles, the desecrated wood.

722
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,860
All of this is on trays in the
basement of the Cairo Museum.

723
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,000
And from there, we were able
to move to a shop bot, which

724
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,760
is a 3D milling machine or router.

725
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,425
And you can see a simple [? Mac ?] with
a 3D model is driving the drill here,

726
00:31:30,425 --> 00:31:33,050
and it's actually
carving those falcon arms

727
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,379
that will go on the sides of the chair.

728
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:38,170
So this has been an exciting project
put together by my colleagues,

729
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,628
Russ [? Gant ?] and [? Dave Hopkins ?]
of the Giza Project.

730
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:43,574
And we're almost done, and we
hope to have this on display

731
00:31:43,574 --> 00:31:45,740
in a couple of months in
the Harvard Semitic Museum,

732
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,150
which I have the privilege to direct.

733
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,800
>> So from that arm, there you go.

734
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,930
You see some of the pieces
already coming together.

735
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,930
For those of you who have
been across the river,

736
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,220
the Harvard Ceramics Center
has donated their time,

737
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,931
and we've been baking [INAUDIBLE]
tiles in these wonderful plaster molds.

738
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:02,180
We just ordered the gold
today because the whole thing

739
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,680
has to be wrapped and gilded.

740
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,200
And eventually, we hope
to put this on display.

741
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,830
>> From there, the question is holistically
again, how do we treat the entire site?

742
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:13,260
How do we build computer
models of all of Giza?

743
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,080
Not just one tomb here or
there, but the whole thing.

744
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,937
The pyramids, the landscape, the
[INAUDIBLE] tombs, the royal temples.

745
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:22,020
And I'm part of a project
that just got permission

746
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,010
from the Egyptian
authorities about a week ago,

747
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,834
and we'll start this
month doing all kinds

748
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,250
of pretty interesting experiments.

749
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,930
So take a look at this video.

750
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,430
Maybe the music could come up a little
bit just to add a little bit of drama.

751
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,310
Just a minute or so.

752
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,020
>> So these are some of the tools we'll
be using to explore inside the pyramids

753
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,056
and survey the entire site.

754
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:44,528
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

755
00:32:44,528 --> 00:33:06,249

756
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:07,290
This is my favorite part.

757
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,590
It's right out of The Terminator with
the drones hovering over the place

758
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:12,718
and scanning the entire landscape.

759
00:33:12,718 --> 00:33:15,176
Something I've been dreaming
of doing for many, many years.

760
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:18,578
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

761
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:22,470

762
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,160
>> So with that kind of comprehensive
accessible to the whole place,

763
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,350
everything is possible.

764
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,820
And our ultimate vision is to put it
all together so you have a navigable,

765
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,090
immersive, 3D model of the whole site.

766
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,435
You can dive down burial shafts, you
can go into tombs, click on walls.

767
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:38,650
The 100-year-old photography pops up.

768
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,760
You can read the diary
entries, you can virtually

769
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,560
replace statues and things
that were found inside.

770
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,246
It all comes together.

771
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:47,620
For those of you who want to
explore what's online so far

772
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:52,290
we have a slightly old and outdated
website up above. gizapyramids.org.

773
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,020
We're working very hard to
replace that with version 2.0.

774
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,826
We could use your help
in various aspects of it.

775
00:33:57,826 --> 00:34:00,200
And then the 3D models that
we're about to take a look at

776
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,660
are down on this other website, which
unfortunately does not work on Macs,

777
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,370
which kills me but nevertheless.

778
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,670
PCs only and no www there.

779
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,310
Take a look at that, and you'll
see the 3D models there as well.

780
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,739
>> There is our new layout.

781
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,230
You can see how massive
amounts of data like this

782
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,860
have to be organized clearly because
it's not all Egyptologists out there.

783
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,370
We've got to make this
understandable and accessible

784
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,010
to all kinds of audiences.

785
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:26,000
And maybe a mock up of what our
future website might look like.

786
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,550
Hopefully a lot more elegant
and not like those creepy

787
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,260
blinking websites from the 1990s
that I remember oh so well,

788
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,250
even from my own days.

789
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,046
>> So I just thought I'd put together
a list of the kind of projects

790
00:34:37,046 --> 00:34:39,920
that you might be interested in if
you're hovering around and looking

791
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,880
for a final project.

792
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,949
I know due dates are
coming up pretty soon.

793
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,000
Something like these might
be of interest to you.

794
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,958
Obviously you want to bite off
something that you can chew and swallow.

795
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:48,899
Not too ambitious.

796
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,440
But if this is something up your
alley, get in touch with me,

797
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,860
get in touch with the
professor, [INAUDIBLE]

798
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,442
get in touch with [? Russ Gant ?]
and the other Giza team

799
00:34:56,442 --> 00:34:58,900
and maybe we can help you out
and build something together,

800
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,260
which might be kind of fun.

801
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,700
We can post this list, so you don't need
to jot everything down instantly right

802
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,200
now.

803
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,524
And check it out later on.

804
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:08,690
And if you really like Ancient Egypt
and want to get into more of this stuff

805
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,481
next semester, there's
a Gen Ed class which

806
00:35:10,481 --> 00:35:12,870
surveys 3,000 or 4,000
years of Egyptian culture,

807
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,860
and you might want to
look into that as well.

808
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,620
>> So that is just a quick overview.

809
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,450
And I thought if my
model is behaving now

810
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:25,290
we might take a look at
what Giza looks like in 3D.

811
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,340
And this is what you would
see on that second website.

812
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,012
So welcome to the Giza Pyramids.

813
00:35:30,012 --> 00:35:32,720
And in this case, we had to study
not just the layout of the site

814
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
but of course the ancient landscape.

815
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,200
Look at the Nile and how
close it is to the pyramids.

816
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,160
Today, the Nile is way far away.

817
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,700
It's much closer to Cairo itself.

818
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,010
But in those days, in
the third millennium,

819
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,270
it was hovering and flowing
much closer to the site as well.

820
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,520
So we had to take away modern
archaeological debris dumps and houses

821
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,610
and all kinds of things and
really study the site carefully.

822
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,150
>> So what we have built so far
you can just hover around.

823
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,980
And you see things blinking red, and
you can visit various places such

824
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,577
as the Temple of [? Kingman ?]
[? Kalray ?] here.

825
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,910
This is an interesting one
because it allows us to study

826
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:07,130
the place at multiple points in time.

827
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,770
This is a temple that was built by
[? Kingman ?] [? Kalray, ?] the builder

828
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,390
of the third and smallest pyramid, but
he died too soon and his son had to try

829
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,700
to finish it not in
stone, but in mud brick.

830
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,490
So I can go to my little free cam here.

831
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,900
Different ways to navigate.

832
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,286
And I can just hover
around and cruise inside.

833
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:27,786
We've got to go visit the kitty cat.

834
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:28,910
One of my favorites.

835
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,480
There he is.

836
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,710
Try to build one of those
for your final project.

837
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,150
>> But the interesting thing
is this particular courtyard

838
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,050
underwent a lot of change.

839
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,220
And so this is how it looked at
one point, and then as I mentioned,

840
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,030
the King died too soon.

841
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,730
Later, priests move in and
actually settled the place

842
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,090
and turned it into a
kind of sacred slum.

843
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:49,320
And you can see all the
settlements now filling

844
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,800
the courtyard with silos and
ovens and other storage place.

845
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,360
[? It's ?] a very, very
different kind of location.

846
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,210
>> So this is an interesting research tool.

847
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,890
You can visit these places
at different points in time.

848
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:03,290
You can even see the pyramids being
built, or you come into the courtyard.

849
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,290
And if I can get to
that photograph, you can

850
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,620
see what those statues
there actually looked

851
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,349
like when the excavators found them.

852
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:11,390
Here it is in one of those
glass plate negatives.

853
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:14,390
Beautiful dig shots.

854
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,130
Or you can come back to the main
site and visit something else.

855
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,524
>> Let me take you inside a
beautiful tomb found in 1927.

856
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:24,440
Of course, on the last
days of the dig season.

857
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,070
Isn't that always the way?

858
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,870
So clicking these buttons will
either give you a narrated tour,

859
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,050
you can see some photos,
you can see wire frames

860
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,150
of how we put some of
these things together,

861
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:37,770
or of course, you could wander
right into the monuments themselves.

862
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:41,050
So this is a beauty because a lot
of the original color was preserved,

863
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,846
and that let us restore
the tomb completely.

864
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:47,600
It's another navigation
system I'm using.

865
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,510
So how cool is that?

866
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,250
And again, you can click on photos
and up popped the actual images

867
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,460
for comparison's sake.

868
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,900
>> So trying to put this all together--
take a comprehensive view of Giza,

869
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,120
the ancient site of Giza, the
history of the excavations,

870
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,970
the 3D visualization, a teaching
tool, a research tool-- basically,

871
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,900
there's no end to it.

872
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,860
And of course, it's Giza past, it's
Giza present, and it's Giza future.

873
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,170
There is work being done
at the site nowadays too,

874
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,150
and we want to capture all that as well.

875
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,670
So the goal is to try to create a
center, if not an actual physical space

876
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,080
but at least online, that anyone
can come and study, have access

877
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
to all this material.

878
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,420
You don't need a special
travel grant and permissions

879
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,520
to get into some dusty museum archive.

880
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,475
You can access whatever you need to.

881
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,120
>> Let me take you to the Sphinx here.

882
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,460
And again, imagine wearing these 3D
headsets and everybody having access

883
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,950
to the same file at the
same time and all of us

884
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,829
meeting at the Sphinx for a lecture.

885
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:43,870
And then push the button.

886
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,706
We'll go down a burial
shaft or go someplace else.

887
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:49,580
The interesting thing about these
models too, once you simulate them,

888
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,040
is they bring up interesting questions.

889
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,140
For example, no one in my
field really thinks too

890
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,100
much about how the Sphinx was painted.

891
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,120
Is that the accurate appearance?

892
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,950
Was the whole thing colored,
or was it just the head

893
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:07,480
of the Sphinx as we've
chosen to do it now?

894
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,840
Switching my navigation.

895
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,340
There we go.

896
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,360
So it's a little easier
for me to get around.

897
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,970
So this is probably one of the
most accurate reconstructions

898
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:19,880
of the Sphinx ever attempted, and
again, you don't think of these issues

899
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,940
until you have to build them.

900
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,630
How was the Sphinx originally laid out?

901
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,490
How was it colored?

902
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,660
Where was that beard?

903
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,330
We haven't added things that were added
by the Egyptians in later centuries

904
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,180
when they came back and sort
of resuscitated the site.

905
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,080
>> Or another example.

906
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,870
We have a tomb with a
window in it to the outside.

907
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,380
And in reconstructing that tomb we
realized the sunlight would come right

908
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,430
through that window and illuminate
a kind of sacred offering

909
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,586
place inside the chapel,
and that's something

910
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:46,960
we wouldn't have realized if
we hadn't simulated the tomb

911
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,240
and put it back together.

912
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,370
And that, in turn, makes you think,
well, what building was right outside

913
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,340
and would it have blocked that sunlight?

914
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,990
And if it blocked that sunlight and that
religious significance of illuminating

915
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,360
a sacred space, does that mean
that our tomb was here first

916
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,190
and the second building came second?

917
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,160
Can we now start to
historically reconstruct

918
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,080
the sequence of Giza tombs just
based on sunlight, just based

919
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,600
on simulations and reconstructions?

920
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,740
>> So those are some of the ways that
we're using these models to study Giza,

921
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:18,190
to teach about Giza, and more
importantly, to roam the world,

922
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,050
assemble all the material
that we can find, and then

923
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,680
move into the 3D space and
the visualization space

924
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,160
and bring it home to your desktops,
to your phones, to your headsets.

925
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,750
And you'll be able to travel
to the site without even

926
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,440
buying a plane ticket eventually.

927
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,695
Thanks very much.

928
00:40:32,695 --> 00:40:36,090
>> [APPLAUSE]

929
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,000

930
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,790
>> Happy to answer a
question or if you have

931
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:42,920
more headsets you want to demonstrate
or anything we need to do in the time

932
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,490
we have left.

933
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,656
If any of those topics caught your eye
and you'd like to hear more about it,

934
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:50,040
do come up afterwards and
happy to chat further.

935
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,210

936
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:53,760
Questions?

937
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,260
Comments?

938
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,030

939
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,159
Yeah?

940
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,075
>> AUDIENCE: Do you have
a position on the idea

941
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:02,707
that there was water
erosion [INAUDIBLE]?

942
00:41:02,707 --> 00:41:04,040
PETER MANUELIAN: Great question.

943
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,620
So water erosion at the Sphinx.

944
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,630
There was a theory by
geologists who thought

945
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,740
that this proved that the Sphinx
was 5,000 or 10,000 years older

946
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,874
than the rest of the pyramids
based on water erosion patterns.

947
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:15,790
It actually doesn't hold
up particularly well.

948
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,070
You can look at the
erosion patterns in areas

949
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,030
around the Sphinx which pretty
much discredit that theory.

950
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,170
>> There are three geological
member formations of the Sphinx.

951
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,470
The solid one is at the top.

952
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:28,000
That's why the face
survived so well today.

953
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,390
Others a lot more [? friable, ?] but
it doesn't hold up archaeologically

954
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,810
that the Sphinx is of a different time
period from the pyramids themselves.

955
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:37,130
There is debate about
who carved the Sphinx.

956
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,540
Whether it was Khafre, the builder
of the second pyramid, or some people

957
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,189
now think Khufu himself, the
builder of the Great Pyramid.

958
00:41:43,189 --> 00:41:45,480
That's an ongoing debate,
but they're all contemporary.

959
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,550
They're all Old Kingdom,
all about 2500 BC.

960
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,940
Great Question.

961
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,990
Yeah, please.

962
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,448
>> AUDIENCE: What was the [INAUDIBLE]?

963
00:41:53,448 --> 00:41:55,065

964
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:56,190
PETER MANUELIAN: Say again.

965
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,688
The head of the Sphinx painted?

966
00:41:57,688 --> 00:41:58,842
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

967
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:00,800
PETER MANUELIAN: Why was
the head of the Sphinx

968
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,410
painted and not the rest of the body?

969
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,040
Great archaeological question,
and we don't know the answer.

970
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,360
It's possible that the
entire body was painted.

971
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,460
It's so deteriorated and the
casing stones around the edge

972
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,960
are not always preserved,
so it may have been painted

973
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,150
and we just don't see
the traces left today.

974
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,790
>> I personally have trouble
believing that the Egyptians would

975
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:22,260
amass that much paint to cover the
entire body with a reddish brown tinge,

976
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,610
but it's certainly possible.

977
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:27,150
We've opted for just doing the headdress
and the face where there are traces

978
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,350
of reddish brown color
and there are traces

979
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,530
of the stripes on the
so-called headdress.

980
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,610
And nowadays, you can see a piece of
the Sphinx's beard in the British Museum

981
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,686
and a piece of the uraeus,
the cobra on the brow there,

982
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,060
is actually in the Cairo museums.

983
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,685
So we have some good evidence for that.

984
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,517

985
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:45,100
In the corner.

986
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,032
Yeah, please.

987
00:42:46,032 --> 00:42:50,280
>> AUDIENCE: You said that the Nile was a
lot more [INAUDIBLE] Giza [INAUDIBLE]

988
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,168
closer to Cairo now.

989
00:42:52,168 --> 00:42:53,590
How does the river more?

990
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,600
>> PETER MANUELIAN: How
does the river move?

991
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,890
There's a lot of meandering.

992
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,130
So a lot of power and pushing
and oxbow lakes and things

993
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:01,420
are part of river formations.

994
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,350
The Nile doesn't quite do that,
but it has meandered quite a bit.

995
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,750
I could refer you to an article by
some geologists colleagues of mine.

996
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,970
And it's an amazing ribbon over
the last several thousand years

997
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,820
of just where the Nile has moved to.

998
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,280
So once you realize that landscape
issues like where the Nile was,

999
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,826
you start to understand, oh,
that's why they built that causeway

1000
00:43:19,826 --> 00:43:21,200
and that's why it turns a corner.

1001
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,630
That must be the high ground
they're trying to stay on.

1002
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,970
And so you understand
harbors a lot better.

1003
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,600
>> You understand how they got
some of the fine casing stones

1004
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,915
to Giza from sites across
the Nile, for example.

1005
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:34,290
So these all contribute to
our understanding of the site.

1006
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:37,950
It's a little myopic to just study
the hieroglyphs or study the buildings

1007
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,620
and not understand the
landscape and how it changed.

1008
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,346
Egypt was a lot less arid at that point
to, so there may even be landscaping

1009
00:43:44,346 --> 00:43:46,970
around the pyramids that we should
be putting in and a lot more

1010
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,297
growth and vegetation
and interesting things.

1011
00:43:50,297 --> 00:43:52,380
Some of the issues in the
models I didn't show you

1012
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,440
but we have in our
visualization center classroom

1013
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,360
is the ability to put humans into the
scene as avatars performing activities.

1014
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,320
And so for example, we can show
the Great Pyramid being built

1015
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,960
and take you to the query where a
lot of the stones are being carved.

1016
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,580
And that's a model that
as 2,000 avatars all

1017
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,810
traveling around the site and hacking
the limestone bits and hauling them

1018
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,510
along sleds and things like that.

1019
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,630
So it also brings the
site to life and shows you

1020
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,660
how the construction process worked.

1021
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,270
>> We've also done the re-animation
ceremony of King Khufu.

1022
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,530
That's called the opening
of the mouth ceremony.

1023
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,045
So in his temple, right beside his
pyramid, we have got his mummy there,

1024
00:44:29,045 --> 00:44:29,920
the priest are there.

1025
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,420
They're doing their ritual gestures.

1026
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,970
They're saying the spells
to magically reanimate

1027
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:36,607
the spirit of the deceased
King for the nether world.

1028
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,690
So these are all ways that
the models can actually

1029
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,956
show us actual activities
of the ancient Egyptians.

1030
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:43,830
And there again, they
bring up new questions.

1031
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:44,659
Did it occur here?

1032
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:45,450
Did it occur there?

1033
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,324
Should it be daytime?

1034
00:44:46,324 --> 00:44:47,400
Should it be nighttime?

1035
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,820
All of these things you don't think
about when you're writing a journal

1036
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,660
article with black and
white line drawings,

1037
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,440
but you're doing an
animated 3D simulation.

1038
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,029
Yes, please?

1039
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:56,904
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1040
00:44:56,904 --> 00:44:59,527

1041
00:44:59,527 --> 00:45:01,110
PETER MANUELIAN: Little louder, sorry.

1042
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,051
Can't hear you.

1043
00:45:02,051 --> 00:45:05,210
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] do these models
incorporate sounds [INAUDIBLE]?

1044
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,370
>> PETER MANUELIAN: Are there
sounds in the model here?

1045
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,328
Was that your question?

1046
00:45:07,328 --> 00:45:08,630
Yes, there are actually.

1047
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,810
Sometimes it's music to certain tastes,
but we do have rumblings of the wind,

1048
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,620
for example.

1049
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,730
We haven't recreated people actually
speaking in ancient Egyptian.

1050
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,200
They could, but we'd probably get
the pronunciations pretty bad.

1051
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,880
There are spells and rituals and things
represented on the carved tomb wall

1052
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,320
scenes and paintings, so
we could certainly do that.

1053
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,880
The occasional cat probably
screeches and things like that,

1054
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,540
but otherwise we haven't
done too much with the audio.

1055
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,040
Ambiance.

1056
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,520

1057
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,090
Another question?

1058
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,053
Yes, please.

1059
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:45,284
>> AUDIENCE: Why are there exterior walls?

1060
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,200
PETER MANUELIAN: Why are
there exterior walls?

1061
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,660
These are enclosure walls.

1062
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,460
So don't think of the pyramid
as a standalone monument.

1063
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,779
Think of it as a pyramid, a temple.

1064
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:56,070
You see that reddish one with
the granite blocks there?

1065
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,970
That's called the Pyramid Temple.

1066
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,320
It extends down a long
causeway to what's

1067
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,660
called the Valley Temple close to
the harbor and close to the Nile.

1068
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,080
All of that is part of
the royal pyramid complex,

1069
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,540
and it could also
include little pyramids

1070
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,132
like you see here for the queens
and even a ritual pyramid,

1071
00:46:13,132 --> 00:46:14,840
like you see here,
where no one is buried

1072
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:20,150
but it's just part of the animated
deceased's spirit of the deceased King.

1073
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,710
So enclosure walls are
probably to protect it.

1074
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,410
>> Who has access to this place?

1075
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,950
Remember, these are the upper
echelons of Egyptian society.

1076
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,540
Your average, illiterate,
farming Egyptian

1077
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,180
is not going to get a tomb like this.

1078
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,513
He's never going to see pharaoh.

1079
00:46:32,513 --> 00:46:33,650
He can't read hieroglyphs.

1080
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,940
So these are the elites of
the elite of the Old Kingdom,

1081
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:39,151
and they get enclosure
walls to protect them.

1082
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:41,980

1083
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:43,036
Got time for one more.

1084
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:46,850

1085
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,300
Yeah, please.

1086
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,160
>> AUDIENCE: Why were the pyramids built?

1087
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,035
>> PETER MANUELIAN: Why
were the pyramids built?

1088
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:54,130
They are basically tombs
for the deceased pharaoh.

1089
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,600
So in the popular
literature, in the movies,

1090
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,630
you've got this despotic tyrant who
is bringing all these slaves in--

1091
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:00,880
and they're not Hebrew slaves.

1092
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,280
They're actual Egyptians.

1093
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,240
I tend to stay away
from the word slavery.

1094
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,259
These are conscripted Egyptians.

1095
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:08,050
And my view is that
they're actually buying

1096
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,410
into this national project in some way.

1097
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,400
By guaranteeing a successful
afterlife for this King

1098
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,700
they are guaranteeing the
prosperity of the country.

1099
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,080
They're paving the way for
the next pharaoh who will

1100
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,420
inhabit this institution of kingship.

1101
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,890
So these are national pride
projects for the reigning pharaoh,

1102
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,450
for the success of the country.

1103
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,710
It's almost an investment
in their future in a way.

1104
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,126
>> A colleague of mine likes to
say that the Egyptians didn't

1105
00:47:30,126 --> 00:47:30,930
build the pyramids.

1106
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,300
The pyramids built Egypt.

1107
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,840
And by that he means that this is
how state formation came about.

1108
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,090
Project management information.

1109
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:39,660
Management.

1110
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,960
Of course, these people have to
be fed, they have to be housed,

1111
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,150
they have to be organized.

1112
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,400
Where does all that come from?

1113
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,190
>> Who brings them the meat so
they have good diets so they

1114
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,880
have strength to move the blocks?

1115
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,320
Who organizes the housing?

1116
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,736
Where do they come from in
different parts of the country?

1117
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:55,200
How many people do you need
to haul a certain block?

1118
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,570
All of this had to be worked
out, and we're exploring

1119
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,190
those aspects of the site today too.

1120
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,120
So more chapters about the
pyramids will be written,

1121
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,050
more discoveries will be made,
more statues will be found,

1122
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,910
and more tombs and inscriptions
will be forthcoming as well.

1123
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,360
The place is alive and growing.

1124
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,431
Thanks very much.

1125
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:14,571
