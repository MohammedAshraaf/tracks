1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,994
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:02,994 --> 00:00:32,934

3
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:35,429
>> SPEAKER 1: It's CS50,
Harvard University.

4
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,423
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

5
00:00:38,423 --> 00:01:04,819

6
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,027
DAVID J. MALAN: [INAUDIBLE] is probably
in the latter half of the phone book,

7
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:13,751
I can now tear the problem in half.

8
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,610
That was actually real, that struggle.

9
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,514
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

10
00:01:18,514 --> 00:01:49,200

11
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,080
>> SPEAKER 2: You humans
are so easy to beat.

12
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,160

13
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:01,240
>> DAVID J. MALAN: All right, this is CS50.

14
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,610
This is the start and
the end of week 12.

15
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,360
And you may recall
that in week zero, this

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,443
is the messaging with which we began,
that it doesn't matter where you end

17
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:10,900
up relative to your classmates,
but where you today,

18
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,900
and maybe just a few weeks from now, end
up relative to yourself some weeks ago.

19
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,360
>> And in fact, we do hope after so
many problem sets, and so many hours,

20
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,850
and a couple of quizzes, and
still with the final project,

21
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,290
that you do feel particularly proud
having come all the way from week

22
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,200
one where this, perhaps, was
the earliest of struggles,

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,840
whether in the standard edition
or the hacker edition thereof.

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,880
And I would propose, that at some point
in your free time, that you go back

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,250
and see your PHP, your
JavaScript, and see

26
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,040
if you can't implement this far,
far faster and more comfortably

27
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,510
than you once upon a time did ago.

28
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,380
>> Indeed, after this, recall you did
cryptography, you did the game of 15,

29
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,350
you did forensics challenges,
you did the fastest spell

30
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,140
checker that you could, you did
CS50 finance, the CS50 mash-up,

31
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,860
and then now, ultimately,
your own final project.

32
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,060
And so today, we try to get closure,
and look at where we've come,

33
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,470
and where we're going.

34
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,550
And just to reassure too, that once
all of the remaining training wheels

35
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,821
come off, you pretty much
have sufficiently many tools

36
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,570
in your tool kit to
now go off and do most

37
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,220
anything in the world of programming.

38
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,390
>> Certainly considering taking some
higher level course can be of advantage.

39
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,752
But realize too, that even if this is
the last CS course you take, realize

40
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:18,710
that on Mac OS, there's
so many different tools

41
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,390
that you can use independent of having
to use something like the CS50 IDE.

42
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,050
Nearly the same tools exist for
Windows, for Linux, and more.

43
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,180
And indeed, one of the goals CS50 in
using this fire hose of languages, C,

44
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,640
and PHP, and Sequel, and
JavaScript, and HTML, and CSS,

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,890
is to really make sure that
you don't exit this course

46
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,385
thinking, I learned c, but rather
that you learned how to program,

47
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,110
and that you understand a little
something about computer science

48
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,700
itself.

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,741
>> In fact, even though we haven't looked
at all of the following languages,

50
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:49,295
it's fun now to enter this community
of folks who find geeky humor funny.

51
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,670
And even though some of the
languages you're about to see

52
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,190
might not be totally
familiar, you'll at least

53
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,080
get a few chuckles from at least
one familiar language, JavaScript.

54
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,425
This was a talk by a particularly
well-versed programmer

55
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:03,100
some time ago entitled, Wat.

56
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,460
And we thought we would give you a
glimpse at how computer scientists tend

57
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,250
to think, or at least talk.

58
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,184

59
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,140
>> GARY BERNHARDT: All right good.

60
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,570
You guys know what wat means?

61
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,740

62
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,820
Wat.

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,540
Exactly, exactly.

64
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,800
Let's talk about Ruby.

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,270
In Ruby, if you reference an
undefined variable, of course

66
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,470
it NameErrors, as you would expect.

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,190
And if you try to assign b to a
with them undefined, of course

68
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,060
it NameErrors, as you'd expect.

69
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,673
And what happens if you try to
assign a to a, with a undefined?

70
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:43,660
>> AUDIENCE: Nil.

71
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,910
>> GARY BERNHARDT: Correct, nil.

72
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:47,495
Wat.

73
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:53,284
>> [LAUGHTER]

74
00:04:53,284 --> 00:04:54,200
Let's talk about Ruby.

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,090

76
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,940
Ruby, unlike some other dynamic
languages, does not have bare words.

77
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,730
So you cannot just type words in, and
have strings come out unless you define

78
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,070
a particular method_missing
that does the right thing.

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,010
And then, if you type bare words,
suddenly, Ruby supports bare words.

80
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,360
And in fact, it will even support
bare words with bangs in them.

81
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,100
And this is not deserving of wat.

82
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,310
This is actually a result
of how awesome Ruby is.

83
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,400
But if you ever actually
do this, then, wat.

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,590
>> [LAUGHTER]

85
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,375
>> Let's talk about JavaScript.

86
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,720

87
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,440
Does anyone know, in JavaScript,
what array plus array is?

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,913
Well, let me ask you this first,
what should array plus array be?

89
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:45,900
>> AUDIENCE: Empty array.

90
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,430
>> GARY BERNHARDT: Empty array, I
would also accept type error.

91
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,830
That is not what array plus array is.

92
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,345
Wrong, wrong, array plus
array is empty string.

93
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:59,330
>> [LAUGHTER]

94
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:03,040
>> Obviously, I think that's
obvious to everyone.

95
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,790
Now what would array plus object be?

96
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,498
This should obviously be type
error, because those are completely

97
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:08,730
disparate types.

98
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,240
Does anyone know what this is?

99
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,900
>> AUDIENCE: False.

100
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,764
>> GARY BERNHARDT: No, close, no, far away.

101
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:14,680
AUDIENCE: It's object.

102
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,955
GARY BERNHARDT: It's object.

103
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,950
Yeah, right, nicely done.

104
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,740
>> Now, of course, because this is
plus, you can flip the operands

105
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,100
and the same thing comes out.

106
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,860
So if we do-- what?

107
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,550
No, that's just an object.

108
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,340
If you do object plus array you
should get exactly the same thing.

109
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,865
Which as you can see, you do.

110
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:36,540
>> [LAUGHTER]

111
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,940
>> And finally, the only one of
these that's actually true

112
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,510
is-- because you add arrays and you get
empty string, it doesn't make sense.

113
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:47,334
But an object plus an object is
actually not a number, technically.

114
00:06:47,334 --> 00:06:49,150
>> [LAUGHTER]

115
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,450
>> So this one's actually right.

116
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,670

117
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,470
Exactly, right, like what is even
going on in this lang-- I just,

118
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:02,172
I don't even understand what
person with a brain in their head

119
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,005
would think that any
of this is a good idea.

120
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:07,690
>> [LAUGHTER]

121
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,859
>> OK, OK, enough making fun
of languages that suck.

122
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:11,025
Let's talk about JavaScript.

123
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:13,820
>> [LAUGHTER]

124
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,210
>> If I say array dot new
16, or just array(16),

125
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,350
I get an array of 16
things, which it represents

126
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,260
as 16 commas, which is obvious.

127
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,060
If I then join those with a string,
then I get the string 16 times.

128
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,527
This is actually the only line in this
entire presentation that's reasonable.

129
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:35,610
Now, if I take that string
and then add a 1 to it,

130
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,270
it interprets the 1 as--
casts the 1 to a string,

131
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,270
and then we get wat1 a
bunch of times, fine.

132
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,688
Does anyone know what will happen
if I subtract 1 from the string?

133
00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:47,680
>> [LAUGHTER]

134
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,030
>> I'm assuming no one does.

135
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,080
Let me-- I'll give you a hint.

136
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,290
Does this help?

137
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,860
Does anyone know?

138
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:05,162
>> [LAUGHTER]

139
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:05,662
Watman.

140
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:14,972
[LAUGHTER]

141
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:15,680
That's all I got.

142
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,480
Thank you guys.

143
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,244
>> [APPLAUSE]

144
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:25,410
DAVID J. MALAN: Let's take a quick look
at some of the things ahead for you.

145
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,710
So the CS50 Hackathon is
this epic all-nighter,

146
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,780
during which you, and your classmates
from Yale, will dive into--

147
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,350
but hopefully not begin--
your final project.

148
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,850
The evening will begin at 7:00 PM.

149
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,580
First dinner will be roughly at 9:00 PM.

150
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,054
Second dinner will be at 1:00 AM.

151
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:39,929
And then, for those
still standing, breakfast

152
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,870
will be served at IHOP
at around 5:00 AM.

153
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,180
>> You might see such scenes as this.

154
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,930
As promised, in week
zero this year, we'll

155
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,090
have not only food, and dinner, and
candy, but also for the second time

156
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,070
in history, vegetables.

157
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,902
But around 3 or 4 AM, scenes like
this are not all that uncommon.

158
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,110
Indeed we see our fair share of pillows
being brought to the Hackathon, which

159
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,200
is fine as well.

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,890
And then the climax of the course
is the so-called CS50 fair.

161
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,290
There's one both here, and
in New Haven a week after.

162
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,431
The one at Harvard is
Monday, December 7,

163
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:10,180
during the afternoon
in Northwest Science.

164
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,710
>> And upon arrival, you will check in.

165
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,380
And you will see such things
as popcorn, and balloons,

166
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,180
and ultimately, as of last
year, over 2000 people coming

167
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,270
to see your final project,
students, staff, and faculty

168
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,630
from across campus and even off-campus.

169
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,250
And if it weren't enough incentive
to come see you yourself,

170
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,490
realize that your
friends can be encouraged

171
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,534
to come to see Asana, and eBay, and
Facebook, and Google, and Microsoft,

172
00:09:32,534 --> 00:09:34,950
and Palantir, and Quora, and
others, recruiters and alumni

173
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,699
from these various companies to
talk about life in the real world,

174
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,790
opportunities both full time and
summertime in the actual industry.

175
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,920
>> And if that weren't reason
enough to come see you,

176
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,420
your friends can be encouraged to
enter the raffle whereby, upon arrival,

177
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,510
you as students will each be handed
a bunch of smiley face stickers.

178
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,500
And attendees, like your friends,
will be handled a little raffle card

179
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,260
upon arrival.

180
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,920
And for every person they
chat up, they will be

181
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,310
handed, by you, a smiley face sticker.

182
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:06,270
Each of which represents an entry
into a raffle with fabulous prizes,

183
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,155
among them an Xbox, a Wii, and a
whole bunch of other fun things,

184
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,780
some of which we've seen here in class.

185
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,780
So stay tuned for that.

186
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,490
>> But ultimately, it's entirely
about the accomplishments

187
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,130
this semester, and the
expressions, and excitement

188
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,870
that you will stir in those attending.

189
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,660
Where you, ultimately, are
wearing your very own-- this,

190
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,330
I took CS50 t-shirts like that here.

191
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,790
So do encourage your
friends to head to this URL

192
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,760
here, which will send you
to all details therefore.

193
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,080
>> Meanwhile, if you're considering another
look at computer science this spring,

194
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,560
or beyond, realize that this is the
same handout-- albeit updated since week

195
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,935
zero-- that we handed out.

196
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:39,810
And if you go to the
middle of this booklet--

197
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,040
there's copies in the transept
outside-- realize this shows you

198
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,740
via arrows exactly what
courses you can go off

199
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,100
to explore this spring, next
fall, summertime, and beyond.

200
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,920
So do take a look at the chart
therein to get a sense of things.

201
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,170
And if you'd like to get
involved in other capacities,

202
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,520
do know, if you don't already,
that the College Board-- which

203
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,880
you may have some not
so fond memories of--

204
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,650
has nonetheless just creating a new
curriculum framework called AP Computer

205
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,517
Science Principles.

206
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:06,850
Something you might have
taken, or at least heard about,

207
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:09,410
an existing CS course
at high schools called

208
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,210
APCSA, which is a fairly
mundane class that

209
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,920
focuses way too much on the language
Java and the mechanics thereof.

210
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,250
>> APCS principles, meanwhile, will
be more about ideas, and more

211
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,400
about problem solving.

212
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,530
And toward this end, we, a bunch of
our friends at UC Berkeley, at co.org,

213
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,340
and a few other entities
around the world

214
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:29,480
are creating curricula that
will satisfy APCS principles.

215
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,170
Which is to say that CS50 AP will
be a AP equivalent that students

216
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,470
in various high schools across the
world can take starting this coming fall

217
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,214
2016.

218
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,880
And if you'd like to get involved
in secondary school education,

219
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,350
and involved in this outreach,
do reach out to us there,

220
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,990
whether you're a TF, a CA, or simply
interested in education at large.

221
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,400
>> And indeed, if you'd like
to join CS50's own team,

222
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,440
realize that as soon as term
ends, we'll begin recruiting

223
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,870
for Teaching Fellows, Course Assistants,
as well as the many artists that

224
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,740
make this course possible
behind the scenes,

225
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,420
creating its online assets, its
in-person opportunities, and more.

226
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,540
So if any of these roles here appeal,
do let us know at this URL here.

227
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,220
Now in a little while, we'll turn to,
just as we did in week zero, some cake.

228
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,280
This time it'll be
downstairs in the pub.

229
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,910
So head there later on.

230
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,580
But I did just want to take a moment
to recognize really what this cake here

231
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,860
represents, or perhaps more canonically,
what this here face-off represents.

232
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,372
>> It has truly been an honor, honestly,
to be partnering with our friends

233
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:31,080
down the road in New
Haven this semester.

234
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,170
It's certainly been a strange
thing, an unusual thing,

235
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,580
dare say an unprecedented
thing for two colleges

236
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,479
to be coming together, offering
one course in the same,

237
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:42,520
on two different campuses and bringing
these two student bodies together.

238
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,740
But it's been such an
honor to work with Andi,

239
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,146
with Scass, and with Jason in New Haven,
and the entirety of our 44 person staff

240
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:51,020
of Teaching Assistants,
and course Assistants

241
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,250
in New Haven, who, for the first time in
Yale's history, were mostly themselves

242
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,090
undergraduates.

243
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,720
>> Indeed, until this year, fall
2015, Yale did not actually

244
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,030
have a tradition or an
allowance for undergraduates

245
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,524
leading sections and
serving as teaching fellows

246
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,690
much like we've enjoyed
here within computer science

247
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:07,920
at Harvard for some time.

248
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,700
And so that alone has been an
extraordinary opportunity for us

249
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,100
to partner with them on
that initiative, and bring

250
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,069
into the fold such leaders as Andi
and other teachers there on campus.

251
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:20,110
And allow me to draw special attention
too, to this fellow in the middle.

252
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,660
Even though he now lives in New
Haven-- largely because we sent him

253
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,160
there-- this is all the result of
Jason Hirschhorn having been a Teaching

254
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,670
Fellow for CS50 for
quite a few years here,

255
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,190
graduated last year, Kirkland House.

256
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,750
And ultimately-- I think
got a phone call from me

257
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,140
at one point that pretty
much reduced to, hey,

258
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,124
would you mind moving to
New Haven after graduation?

259
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:42,790
This was all because we were
trying to stand up this initiative,

260
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,739
and we want to make sure that there
was institutional knowledge down

261
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:48,530
there in New Haven because we were
building something from scratch.

262
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,660
And if-- Jason, if you could maybe
just come on up awkwardly toward stage,

263
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,909
so we can at least all see
Jason Hirschhorn in person.

264
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:59,350
[APPLAUSE]

265
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,840
>> Surely, without Jason, Yale 50
would not have been possible.

266
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,960
So our thanks to Jason Hirschhorn.

267
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,900
And also, we have a huge staff that
we won't draw personal attention

268
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,130
to everyone here, but
over 100 individuals

269
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,130
here in New Haven who
make this course possible.

270
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,088
And you might just see
your own Teaching Fellow

271
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,900
on this list, whether
here or a New Haven.

272
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,430
And so if we could, a
huge round of applause

273
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,060
for the entirety of the teaching staff.

274
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,200
>> [APPLAUSE]

275
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,190
>> And let me draw some special
attention to a few of the folks

276
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,045
here, especially Hannah, and
Maria, and Daven, and Rob, who,

277
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:38,220
as the courses head, make
everything run here in Cambridge.

278
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,710
Of course, Colton Ogden, who begins most
of our lectures over there on music.

279
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,186

280
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:51,750
Doug Lloyd, who-- this is CS50 AP,
who was leading our AP initiative.

281
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,750
Dan Armendariz, without whom we
would not have a CS50 IDE this year.

282
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,430
Aliess, who makes everything
possible behind the scenes,

283
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,600
including running the
lights as pictured here.

284
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,680
And then last, but not least,
CS50's production team.

285
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,970
>> Suffice it to say, it's
CS50's production team

286
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,430
that empowers so many of us
to sleep in in the afternoons,

287
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,251
and to engage with the course's
material really asynchronously.

288
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,750
And this is very much one of
the design goals of the course.

289
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,860
As you know, we are-- enjoy
right now an opportunity

290
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,272
to allow simultaneous enrollment.

291
00:15:20,272 --> 00:15:22,230
We have an opportunity
for students, certainly,

292
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,820
to watch these courses-
materials online,

293
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,100
even in real time live right now.

294
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,715
And this is entirely because of
the production team that you see,

295
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,060
or even don't see around
you, and behind you here.

296
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,910
>> For instance, this was some footage
shot by Jordan this past year,

297
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,890
just to speak to the sort of artistry
that goes on behind the scenes.

298
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,460
This, of course, is FoHo in the Quad.

299
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,440
And just to give you a
look back at week zero,

300
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,340
this was the imagery with
which we began the first week.

301
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:56,320
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

302
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,350
>> That was from CS50's own Jordan.

303
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:05,590
And also behind the scenes here today
is Ramon, and Ian, and Scully, and Dan

304
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,920
Coffey.

305
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,067
Dan Coffey, who heads
CD50's production team.

306
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,900
And truly over the past
several years-- this

307
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,340
is my ninth year involved
with the course-- really has

308
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,740
Dan Coffey, with the production
team, taken CS50 to another level.

309
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,410
Not only do we shoot the
course now in 4K, so to speak,

310
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,500
this coming year we'll also
be able to shoot it in 6K.

311
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,440
As well as in virtual reality,
partly because it's cool--

312
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,496
partly because it's cool,
but also as you know,

313
00:16:33,496 --> 00:16:35,400
we have a very sizable online community.

314
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,977
Folks who, for various
reasons, could not travel to,

315
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,060
or could not attend a place
like Harvard and Yale.

316
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,420
>> And one of the goals pedagogically is to
experiment with new forms of technology

317
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,910
so that we can, through proxy, and
through you all, give online students

318
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,660
around the world an opportunity
to see, and feel, and hear

319
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,630
what a place like Harvard
or Yale feels like.

320
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,290
So coming soon, in fall 2016.

321
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,150
And now to take it down a notch,
this is about to be horrifying.

322
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,300
>> But you might recall that most
of the lecture videos this year,

323
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,560
or every other, ends with a sort of
seemingly strange clip from Seinfeld,

324
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,310
inspired by some actual episode
re-implemented by CS50's production

325
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,940
team, who have been incredibly
gracious and creative.

326
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,290
And I thought I will show you one of
the inspirations, a 30 second clip,

327
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,700
from an actual Seinfeld show
that inspired one of this

328
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,060
semester's-- I'm told-- favorite clip.

329
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,981
So first, an actual clip from Seinfeld.

330
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,339
>> ELAINE: C'mon who's dancing?

331
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,963
Want me to-- want me to get it started?

332
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,945
I'll get it started.

DAVID J. MALAN: So we often
talk about pushing students

342
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,400
beyond their own comfort zones.

343
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,850
I, now, am going to crawl
up into a ball and sob

344
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,590
as we play for you this
re-implementation of this,

special things for an alumna

358
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,480
who is now doing her PhD just
down the road here at Harvard.

359
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,540
And who could most often be seen
in this form in office hours,

360
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,140
both in Cambridge, and in New Haven.

361
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,910
In fact, if we enhance-- a big round
of applause for CS50's own, Zamyla.

362
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:00,500
And now, a word from CS50 staff
in both locations who would

363
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,569
like to offer some parting
words of their own.

364
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:04,610
ANNALEAH ERNST: There is
no other course in which

365
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,430
everyone who works for the course
is as excited to be there, and be

366
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:11,720
involved in it, as CS50.

367
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,860
I don't know, it's like this really
important and special responsibility,

368
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,515
and kind of an incredible experience.

369
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:20,056
And I'm really glad I get to be
a part of people's education.

370
00:19:20,056 --> 00:19:22,802
SPEAKER 3: CS50, in my
opinion, is amazing.

371
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:24,170
I love it.

372
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,970
I loved it when I was taking a class.

373
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,392
And I love it even more as a TA.

374
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:30,100
JORDAN HAYASHI: CFing is a lot of
work, but it's really rewarding

375
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,541
because you get to teach so much.

376
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,082
You really get to know your students.

377
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:35,260
You get to know the material yourself.

378
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,090
And you get to just watch them
become computer scientists.

379
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,492

the highlight of my semester.

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,220
DAVID MCPEEK: I've just never felt
as much as a leader on campus,

384
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,240
as I have this semester.

385
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,510
>> SAM LEVATICH: This is one of the
only opportunities on Yale's campus

386
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,520
to really get invested in teaching.

387
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,021
>> SPEAKER 5: It's really cool to
see CS50 from the other side.

388
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:15,770
NICK JOSEPH: I was surprised at
how excited all the students were.

389
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,718
ARIANNA BENSON: It's
also nice when people

390
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,603
recover a picture of Rick Astley,
and are like, who is that?

391
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:23,394
DAVID ARMENTA: I wanted to give
back because I got a lot of support

392
00:20:23,394 --> 00:20:24,269
when I was a student.

393
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:29,630
MARY FARNER: All you need is enthusiasm
and a love of teaching, or CS,

394
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,288
or any of the above, and
you'll be able to do it.

395
00:20:32,288 --> 00:20:34,371
SAM LEVATICH: All my
students keep Rickrolling me.

ANNALEAH ERNST: It's been so much
fun to teach about this thing

399
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,009
that I really love, and
think it's a lot of fun,

400
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:08,470
and try to other people
excited about it as well.

401
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,830

>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

404
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:27,210
DAVID J. MALAN: And now, you may recall
that we began this semester talking

405
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,390
ultimately about computational thinking
in solving problems independent

406
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,160
of actual programming languages.

407
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,330
And we thought we'd
see just to what extent

408
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,369
this has sunk in by trying an
exercise we didn't do in week zero,

409
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:39,160
but we thought we'd
try a couple times here

410
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,220
in week 12, for which
I need a volunteer who

411
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,560
is comfortable coming up here on stage.

412
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,060
>> Come on up.

413
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,855
What's your name?

414
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:46,480
>> YAHONG: Yahong.

415
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,370
DAVID J. MALAN: Yahong,
come on up, this way.

416
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,763
And if you all, if you have
a sheet of paper from us

417
00:21:50,763 --> 00:21:53,790
or a blank sheet of paper of your
own, go ahead and take that out

418
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,830
at this point.

419
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,380
Nice to meet you.

420
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,490
All right, Yahong's goal here
is going to be the following,

421
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:06,370
I have here a drawing that only
she is going to be able to see.

422
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,710
Come on over here in the
middle, if you'd like.

423
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,760
And let me give you a microphone here.

424
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,710
And your goal here is
going to be to describe,

425
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,440
in as precise detail as
possible, what you see.

426
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,380
>> And these folks here, as the sort
of computer implementers of this,

427
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,140
need to draw exactly what you say.

428
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,770
And then, what I'll do is grab a
few random samples from the audience

429
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,895
and we'll see just how
precisely this worked out.

430
00:22:27,895 --> 00:22:29,020
YAHONG: So I describe this.

431
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,478
DAVID J. MALAN: You described this.

432
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:34,317
You tell your hundreds of classmates
here exactly what to draw, go.

433
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:36,650
YAHONG: OK, so in the very
middle of the piece of paper,

434
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,290
there are two shapes,
one on top of the other,

435
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,380
but not touching, but almost touching.

436
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,575
So there is a circle on the
top, and a square on the bottom,

437
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:45,950
and they're almost the same size.

438
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,600
They're kind of medium, small.

439
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,810
And within the circle, there are
two-- there are three squares.

440
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:59,460
So there's a little square within a
bigger square, within a bigger square.

441
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,660
And within the square on the
bottom, there are three circles.

442
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,515
A little circle within a bigger
circle, within a bigger circle.

443
00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:06,556
DAVID J. MALAN: Got that?

444
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:07,719
AUDIENCE: No.

445
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,010
DAVID J. MALAN: So why don't
you-- I'll go walk around.

446
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:13,200
I'll grab a few, and if you want to
recap for those who need a second path.

447
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,810
>> YAHONG: OK, do you need
me to explain this again?

448
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,630
OK, all right, so in the middle of the
sheet of paper there are two shapes.

449
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,710
And one is on top of the other,
but they're roughly the same size.

450
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:29,850
There is a medium small circle
on top of a medium small square.

451
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,900
OK, so it's kind of like on top,
think about putting it like a snowman,

452
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,720
but with two different shapes
instead of two circles.

453
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,100
And then on the--
inside the circle, there

454
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,047
is a small box, inside of another
small box, inside of another small box.

455
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,130
And inside of the square,
there is a small circle,

456
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,371
inside of another small circle,
inside of another small circle.

457
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:52,306
Did that make sense?

458
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,139
DAVID J. MALAN: Yes.

459
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,405
YAHONG: A lot of pressure.

460
00:23:54,405 --> 00:23:56,800
DAVID J. MALAN: All right,
I will be right back.

461
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,580
Going through the audience
here, OK, very nice.

462
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,060
Thank you, OK we've
got to take that one.

463
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,830
All right, that seems like a
good random sample, thank you.

464
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,330
All right.

465
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,996
>> YAHONG: Awesome.

466
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:08,720
DAVID J. MALAN: So now-- also?

467
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,500
>> YAHONG: Awesome.

468
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,360
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Oh, awesome, OK.

469
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,670
So awesome, stay right there.

470
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,290
I'm going to go ahead and reveal to you
what some of your classmates here did.

471
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:22,260
So here we have this one here.

472
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,410
OK, it sort of just
keep going and going.

473
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,920
Here, a little different interpretation.

474
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,020

475
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:40,370
OK, here, let's see, getting
closer, albeit smaller, very nice.

476
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,200
Though, I just had to grab this one.

477
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,680
>> [LAUGHTER]

478
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,500
>> What was the actual answer?

479
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,300
Let's take a look over here.

480
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,600
What she was describing
was this image here.

481
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,490
So man-- some of-- many of you
up here in the ones I looked,

482
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,570
did get this right.

483
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,470
Let's go ahead and show-- let's call
someone else up and see how easily,

484
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,920
or with what level of
difficulty they can do it.

485
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,970
Thank you so much.

486
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,460
How about one other volunteer
a little farther back.

487
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,820
OK, I saw this hand first, come on up.

488
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,280
What's your name?

489
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,119
Oh, sorry?

490
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,660
MARCY: Marcy.

491
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,976
DAVID J. MALAN: Marcy, come
on up, nice to meet you.

492
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:16,850
All right, here we have
a microphone for you.

493
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,940
Let me get a drawing.

494
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,398
And so if you want to just use
the flip side of that sheet,

495
00:25:20,398 --> 00:25:23,780
or some other sheet of paper, I'm
going to go ahead and give Marcy

496
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:32,320
a different one here that only
she can now see-- that only

497
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,330
she can see opaquely, OK.

498
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,210
>> MARCY: OK.

499
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,001
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Go.

500
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,040

501
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,180
>> MARCY: Draw 16 little
dots all in a grid.

502
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,340
So four rows of four dots each.

503
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:55,376
And the dots are hollow, so
they're like tiny little circles.

504
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:56,770
Oh, there are five of them.

505
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,050
OK, it's five.

506
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,930
It's five rows of black dots.

507
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:09,290
Five rows of five dots, and then,
starting on the top left corner-- OK,

508
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,460
so five rows of five dots,
and the dots are hollow,

509
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,630
so they're like tiny
little circles actually.

510
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,250
So they're white on the inside.

511
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,540
>> AUDIENCE: OK.

512
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,280
>> MARCY: OK, so five rows of five dots.

513
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,560
And then, you start
from the top left dot,

514
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,090
and then draw a line
down to the next dot

515
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:34,290
down, and then draw another line to
the one to the right of that one.

516
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,390
So that's two lines so far.

517
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:41,440
And then draw a line down
to the next one down.

518
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,490
OK, so that's three lines,
down, right, and then down.

519
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,470
And then left.

520
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,450
And then down.

521
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,940
>> OK, so recap, it's the
first one is down-- OK,

522
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,740
you're starting from the top left
corner-- and then down, and then right,

523
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:05,040
and then down, and then left, and then
down, and then right, and then right,

524
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,560
and then left.

525
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,980
OK, so we're about half through.

526
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,290

527
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,040
DAVID J. MALAN: You
said right, then left.

528
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,960
MARCY: Oh, whoops, OK.

529
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,860
DAVID J. MALAN: It's not easy.

530
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,840
MARCY: Let's start over.

531
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,590
Let's start over from
the top left corner.

532
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,840
>> DAVID J. MALAN: One more pass.

533
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:33,650
MARCY: Yeah, OK, down, right, down,
left, down, right, right, down, right,

534
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:44,520
up, right, up, left, left, up, up,
right, down, right, up, and you

535
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,880
should be on the top right corner.

536
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,430
OK.

537
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:52,010
>> DAVID J. MALAN: All right, and if you
did that correctly, you should now

538
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,320
have this on your sheet of paper.

539
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,530
So let me come grab a couple.

540
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:09,900
OK, thank you, thank you, thank you,
OK, I don't think you want that.

541
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,690
OK, oh love this, thank you.

542
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,770
Sorry to reach, wow, aw, OK I'm
going to take just that one.

543
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,250
All right, that's
good, that's very good.

544
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,920
All right, so let's
see what we have here.

545
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,400
>> So notice, try to make a
mental imprint of this.

546
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,720
Let me go back to the projection here.

547
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,730
And this is pretty darn
good here, very nicely done.

548
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,430
This one, a little smaller, but
I think that's on the right track

549
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:47,040
as well, very nicely done.

550
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,090
OK, this one I feel like I
shouldn't put this on the internet,

551
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,365
so let me-- this one has a
phone number for some reason.

552
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:57,460
>> [LAUGHTER]

553
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,680
>> Thank you.

554
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,240
And then, why don't we end with this
one and now-- thank you so much--

555
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,950
we have time for one more example here.

556
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,900
This time, how about on
the left there, come on up.

557
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,280
Yup, with your hands, yup.

558
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,200
All right come on up, come on up.

559
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,030
This time though, come on up.

560
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,760
What's your name?

561
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,500
>> DANIEL: Daniel.

562
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,860
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Daniel,
this time though, we're

563
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,280
going to spice this up
a little bit, and we're

564
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,465
going to have you come
over to the touch screen.

565
00:29:28,465 --> 00:29:31,090
So now this time, I'm going to
show all of you all the drawing.

566
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,630
And on the honor system, you may not
move your eyes ever so slightly up here

567
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,300
to see what the actual image is.

568
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,359
So you just keep a--
just straight ahead.

569
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,400
And then you're going to
draw on this screen what

570
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,733
your classmates describe to you.

571
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:46,590
And I'll try to summarize
verbally so it's loud enough.

572
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,925
>> All right, so honor system
here, look straight ahead only,

573
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:54,050
and you all step-by-step-- not unlike
the peanut butter and jelly example--

574
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,550
let's try to describe this.

with the rules of the following

in the form of Jeopardy.

And only after p-set
eight did we decide,

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,050
well, maybe it would
actually be a little more

655
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:08,572

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,090
But if you want to just write
staff on the right and students

673
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,610
on the left for score keeping, let
me go ahead and let each of you

674
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,735
introduce yourselves to
your class on this last day.

675
00:34:11,735 --> 00:34:13,109
JAMES: I'm James, I'm a freshman.

676
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:15,670

677
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,720
>> AARON: Hi, I'm Aaron.

678
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,045
>> MAYA: I'm Maya.

679
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:22,178
>> KATHERINE: I'm Katherine.

680
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:23,969
DAVID J. MALAN: And
now the teaching staff.

681
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:26,199
JACK: I'm Jack.

682
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,579
ABBY: Abby

683
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,944
TIM: Hi, I'm Tim.

684
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:30,485
MARIA: Maria.

685
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,260

686
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,960
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So, we
have in advance, come up

687
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,540
with a number of questions, some of
whose answers we kind of made up,

688
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,440
but others whose answers are
based on actual statistics

689
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,889
from your own submissions of problem
set eight, and other problem sets.

690
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:51,989
So in general, each of these
answers we'll have surveyed,

691
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,980
let's say 100 people, we will put
the top four or five or six answers

692
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,439
on the board, each of which
has a score associated with it.

693
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:00,730
What we're going to do is
tweak the rules a little bit.

694
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,000
So rather than give control
to one team or another,

695
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,510
we're simply going to use the Staples
easy buttons to allow each team

696
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,150
to buzz in the quickest.

697
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,917
And whoever guesses-- hits the button
first, and gets a question right,

698
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:16,500
will potentially get that many points.

699
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,333
We'll keep going, we'll
keep going, and then

700
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:23,065
whichever team finishes the board, will
get all of the points tallied thus far.

701
00:35:23,065 --> 00:35:24,940
So what you'll want to
do is tally the points

702
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,750
as we go for each
question answered right.

703
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,750
And then once the round ends, you're
going to put the total either here,

704
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,600
or over here.

705
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,280
>> MICHAEL: So I tally in my head.

706
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,020
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Or on the screen
in front of everyone, yes,

707
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,040
or on your phone, which
is back there apparently.

708
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,507
All right, so we'll
walk you through this.

709
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:43,840
No need to do anything just yet.

710
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,048
The first thing the students
and the staff need to do

711
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,880
is hit their respective
buttons the fastest

712
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,040
after I start reading the question
and you want to propose an answer.

713
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,130
Make sense?

714
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,710
All right, here we go.

715
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,925
Name a function declared in stdio.h.

716
00:35:55,925 --> 00:36:00,190

717
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,050
Staff.

718
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,950
>> ABBY: Printf.

719
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,550
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Show us printf.

720
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,290
Very nice.

721
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,226
So just write down 68, or
keep track in your mind of 68.

722
00:36:10,226 --> 00:36:11,350
Now we're going to move on.

723
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,190
As soon as I'm going to
read the question again,

724
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,648
you may not buzz in until after
I've repeated the question.

725
00:36:15,648 --> 00:36:17,250
Name a function declared in stdio.h.

726
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,100

727
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,470
Same question

728
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,980
>> JAMES: What is sprintf.

729
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,350
>> DAVID J. MALAN: What is sprintf.

730
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,130

731
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,310
Show us sprintf.

732
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,060
No, I'll read it again.

733
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,280
A function declared in stdio.h.

734
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,780
Staff.

735
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,799
>> TIM: Scanf.

736
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,090
DAVID J. MALAN: Scanf, show us.

737
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,650

738
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,050
Two strikes.

739
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,505
Once more, a function
declared in stdio.h.

740
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:50,380

741
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,496
Students.

742
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:52,470
>> JAMES: Fopen.

743
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,400
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Fopen, very nice.

744
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,430
I'll just keep repeating the question,
a function declared in stdio.h.

745
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,480

746
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,540
Staff.

747
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,270
>> TIM: Fclosed.

748
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,910
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Fclosed, good job.

749
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:12,010
Nice, we have two answers left on
the board, number two and number 5

750
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,100
for this round.

751
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,460
A function declared in stdio.h.

752
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,250
Students.

753
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,210
>> KATHERINE: Fread.

754
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,804
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Show us fread.

755
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:23,620
Very nice.

756
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,250
Whoever now-- whichever team
answers the fifth and last answer,

757
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,680
gets all the points.

758
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,520
So you should be adding all these
numbers up, and whoever gets this,

759
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,310
gets that total.

760
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,870
Is there a mistake?

761
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,035
There is no number six.

762
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:39,890
No number six, unimplemented.

763
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,330
Name a function declared
in stdio-- staff.

764
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,432

765
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:47,520
>> TIM: Fright.

766
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,811
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Show us fright.

767
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:51,440

768
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,690
>> JACK: That explains so much.

769
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,350
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Let's try once more.

770
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,210
Name one-- name a function
declared in stdio.h.

771
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,220
Tim.

772
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:00,830
>> TIM: Fseek.

773
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:01,746
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Fseek.

774
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,350

775
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:08,720
About one more try, name a function
declared in f-- in stdio.h.

776
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,011

777
00:38:12,011 --> 00:38:14,220
>> MARIA: fgetc.

778
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,690
>> DAVID J. MALAN: fgetc.

779
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,270
So no one gets the points.

780
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,440
Colton, want to show us
what number five was?

781
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,110

782
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,735
OK, Matlock is not in stdio.h.

783
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:28,586

784
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:29,710
Jason Hirschhorn everybody.

785
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,252

786
00:38:33,252 --> 00:38:35,210
All right let's move on
to the second question.

787
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,900
First person to buzz in here, to
this question, a program that you

788
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,560
use while programming.

789
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,473
Staff.

790
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:44,400
>> TIM: Clang.

791
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,500
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Clang.

792
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,660
Very nice, number two answer.

793
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,836
Again, name a program you
use while programming.

794
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:53,980

795
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,000
Students.

796
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,730
>> JAMES: GDB.

797
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,563
>> DAVID J. MALAN: GDB.

798
00:38:56,563 --> 00:38:59,060

799
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,960
So at this point, 38 would be the total,
but no one's gotten any points yet.

800
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,490
All right, name a program
used while programming.

801
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,030

802
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,860
>> TIM: Valgrind.

803
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,901
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Valgrind.

804
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:13,332

805
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:17,790
All right, name a program
you use while programming.

806
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,275
Students.

807
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:20,480
>> AARON: PHP.

808
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,000
>> DAVID J. MALAN: PHP Name a
program you use while programming.

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,530

827

One more try, a program

828
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:13,510

829
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,050

Nope, let's reveal the answer.

839
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:35,645
Number six was Spotify.

840
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:39,670
All right, I think we have
time for just one or two more.

841

Complete the following sentence,
no points for either team still.
