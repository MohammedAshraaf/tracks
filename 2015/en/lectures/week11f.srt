1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,632
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

3
00:00:14,632 --> 00:01:05,452

4
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:08,660
DAVID MALAN: So my new Mike is probably
in the latter half of the phone book.

5
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:14,094
I can now tear the problem in half.

6
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:16,564
That was actually real, that struggle.

7
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:20,516
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

8
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:49,740

9
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,268
>> ROBOT: You humans are so easy to beat.

10
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:54,250
>> DAVID MALAN: All right.

11
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,660
This is CS50 and this
is the end of week 11.

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,880
So we do hope, particularly coming on
the heels of quiz one, that all of you

13
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,190
are relieved but also proud
of just how far you've come.

14
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,080
>> Indeed, so many of you-- 72% if
last year is any reflection--

15
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,990
had no prior experience taking a
computer science course before.

16
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,880
And so even if you were feeling
a little less than excited

17
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,020
as to how quiz zero or one or some
particular piece had turned out,

18
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,680
just consider the delta
from today versus week zero.

19
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,487
>> Indeed, this, recall is
pretty much where we started.

20
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:30,070
And for many of you, just getting
those darn for loops to work

21
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,450
may have been an initial challenge and
I would encourage you at some point,

22
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,200
if you'd like some
self assigned homework,

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,990
go back and re-implement Mario, whether
it's in JavaScript or PHP or even in C,

24
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,650
and see just, hopefully, how readily,
that kind of logic now comes to you.

25
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,859
>> Today we wrap up the
course here in New Haven

26
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:48,400
and we give you a sense of what
still is on the horizon, even

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,620
outside of the classroom.

28
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,146
>> First and foremost is
the CS50 Hackathon,

29
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:55,020
an epic all nighter during which
you and your classmates in Cambridge

30
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,540
will have an opportunity to dive
into and continue-- not hopefully

31
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,934
start-- final projects for some 12
hours, arriving around 7:00 PM by buses

32
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,100
that we'll provide here
from New Haven to Cambridge.

33
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,760
>> Around 9:00 PM, we'll serve
first dinner around 1:00 AM,

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,730
we'll serve second dinner,
and around 5:00 AM,

35
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,630
we'll serve breakfast for
those who are still standing.

36
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,470
And you'll see such memories as these
while working through the evening.

37
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,170
Candy, and as promised
in week zero, vegetables

38
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,620
for the second time in
history, as well 4:00 AM,

39
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,730
things start to look a little like this.

40
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,120
>> And then beyond that,
realize that what's ahead

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,940
is the CS50 Fair here at Yale, so
that faculty and students and staff

42
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,000
from across this campus have an
opportunity to delight in exactly how

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,860
much you all pulled off this semester.

44
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,990
Will there be in Commons, the
CS50 Fair on Monday the 14th.

45
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,040
So do keep that in mind and more
to come with details online.

46
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,490
But if Cambridge is any indication,
realize that memories like this

47
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,117
here await.

48
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:52,200
And you should certainly feel free to
invite your friends in the meantime.

49
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,085
>> And if seeing you at the CS50
Fair weren't incentive enough,

50
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:58,710
we thought we would invite some
of our friends from industries.

51
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,920
If you'd like to chat up alumni
and recruiters from eBay,

52
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,660
ESPN, Facebook, Google, Palantir,
YEI, and YHack, and possibly more,

53
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,420
do come by.

54
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,390
>> And if that's not enough to come see
you or the recruiters from industry,

55
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,350
realize that there will be a raffle
with fabulous prizes, among them, these.

56
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,709
And what will happen is, upon
arriving at the fair, both

57
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,100
you and attendees will be handed a
little program for the day's event

58
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,079
telling you what to do.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,100
When, what is there.

60
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,914
>> There will be some little place
holders for smiley face stickers.

61
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:27,830
And all of you, the
students, will get some 10

62
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,580
plus smiley face stickers
and anyone who breaks

63
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,830
that social awkwardness and comes
up to you and says, what did you do?

64
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,330
Or can I see a demo of what you did?

65
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,496
You hand them a sticker and
that sticker is an entry

66
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:40,109
in a fabulous raffle such as this here.

67
00:04:40,109 --> 00:04:42,400
So that should help you break
the ice and give everyone

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,350
a little bit of an excuse
to grease those wheels.

69
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,380
>> And you'll see such expressions
and memories as this one

70
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,250
here, this one here, and
then, proudly, will all of you

71
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,850
have your first ever "I
took CS50" t-shirts as well.

72
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,350
So more on that to come.

73
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,830
>> Now in addition to the
course, is very specifically

74
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,790
offered today as to
what's on the horizon,

75
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,360
realize too that among the
handouts, thanks to Megan,

76
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,400
is Yale's first ever
unofficial guide to CS at Yale,

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,730
where she's wonderfully diagramed
the various paths that you

78
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,770
can take after leaving CS50 or
112 or other courses here at Yale,

79
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,920
so you can explore things well beyond
CS50 itself, if you would like.

80
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,360
And the diagram you'll
see there is exactly that.

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,540
>> And also too, realize that
today, from 3:00 to 4:30

82
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,030
PM is the first ever CS50
Expo here at Yale, over

83
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,320
in Sterling Memorial Library.

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,210
And this is an opportunity
to see some of the projects

85
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,240
that our own teaching staff
and some of the upperclassmen

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,120
here have created in their classes,
in their research projects,

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,850
in entrepreneurial interests of theirs.

88
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,650
So do join us there for snacks and
some amazing opportunities and glimpses

89
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,150
as to what you can now do as
an aspiring computer scientist.

90
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,680
>> And in terms of opportunities now,
with CS50 itself, to get involved,

91
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,420
do realize, if unfamiliar, that
in addition to this college

92
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,320
offering of CS50, the
College Board-- which

93
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,390
you may recall fondly or less fondly--
is in the process of setting up

94
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,410
a new AP Computer Science curriculum.

95
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:05,900
So some of you, a few of you, might have
taken AP CSA, Computer Science A, which

96
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,800
focused, frankly, very much
on the language Java, sort

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,040
of to the exclusion of
inspiration, quite often,

98
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,300
and excitement and problem
solving more generally.

99
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,716
>> What's really nice about a new
curriculum framework that's

100
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,750
being released in fall
2016 from the College Board

101
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,880
is that it will be AP Computer
Science Principles which

102
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,700
is much more akin to more inspiring
CS zero, CS one, CS two courses most

103
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,100
universities might call them.

104
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,700
And there will be a number of
implementations of this course.

105
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,410
UC Berkeley is doing
one. co.org is doing one.

106
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,770
CS50 is doing one.

107
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,478
And so if you have an interest in
getting involved in high school

108
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,080
education and working with
CS50 in the staff capacity,

109
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,070
doing outreach like this, do reach out
to us as well any of the courses heads.

110
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,180
>> And also too, now begins recruiting.

111
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,890
You are all just about to be eligible
to teach this same class here at Yale.

112
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,890
And what's been especially,
frankly, exciting,

113
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:58,600
amazing this past year
is that truly, with CS50,

114
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,770
have we had a team of some 44 largely
undergraduate staff members who

115
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,410
are serving as undergraduate learning
assistants or TAs more generally,

116
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,980
the first time in Yale's history.

117
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,200
And so you will be the second
generation of exactly that opportunity.

118
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,520
>> So we do encourage you to apply either
as a TA or CA in the teaching role

119
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,320
or in a number of other roles.

120
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,550
Suffice it to say, with
all the songs and dances,

121
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,780
literally, that we seem to
have, there's any number

122
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,280
of ways where you can get
involved creatively, artistically,

123
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,330
as well as educationally.

124
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,949
So do let us know via this URL here.

125
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,490
Now a little while from now,
we'll adjourn with our tradition

126
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,132
just as we began this semester with cake
in the dining hall around the corner.

127
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,840
But we'd like to tie
up a few loose ends.

128
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,200
>> And first and foremost, I'd
just like to recognize one.

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
This happened last week.

130
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,290
So I've become acquainted with
"Overheard at Yale," where--

131
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,090
if we, shall we say, enhance
this video, or this photo--

132
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:56,290
you'll see this shirt that I was sold
for $15 and then this photo was taken.

133
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,630
Business, I'm told, has
been good ever since then.

134
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,630
Didn't go over super well back home.

135
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,090
>> But irrespective of how this
weekend goes-- and actually,

136
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,220
one other [INAUDIBLE].

137
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,210
So we made the Rumpus today, CS50.

138
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,830
The hookup Bingo chart, which
is on the back, involves CS50.

139
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,320
I don't really want my words to show up
in the transcript, so I'll just-- OK,

140
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,486
here we go.

141
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:18,860
OK, so that's one of the squares.

142
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,380
>> [LAUGHTER]

143
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,730

144
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,690
>> Won't be able to search
on that word though.

145
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,835
All right.

146
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:28,960
So irrespective of how this particular
weekend turns out with Harvard Yale,

147
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,570
do know it's been an absolute honor
for us and so terribly exciting

148
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,004
to be working with Scass, with Jason,
with Andy, with the entire team here.

149
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,420
Yale vs. Harvard, we're still
working on that, apparently.

150
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,966
>> [LAUGHTER]

151
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:43,090
It really has been special.

152
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,090
And as I've said before,
of all the universities

153
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,750
to collaborate with in this way,
it's truly been special for us

154
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,240
to work here with the team
and the students at Yale.

155
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
So it's been wonderfully gratifying
and we are forever grateful

156
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,090
for this opportunity to be
welcomed as we have been here.

157
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,990
>> Indeed, let me say
some thank yous first,

158
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,730
before we turn things over to some of
you and some audience participation.

159
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,140
First and foremost, to Scass, to Jason,
to Andy, and the entire Yale team.

160
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,315
Thank you for making this
course so amazing here.

161
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:10,640
>> [APPLAUSE]

162
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,870

163
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,920
>> I'd like to draw your
attention to all of the names

164
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,850
that compose CS50's team
both here and in New Haven.

165
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,237
Over 100 of us, colleagues
in both of these towns.

166
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:27,820
And so we won't spend time, I
fear, on every one of the names.

167
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,930
I did want to draw your
attention to one fellow,

168
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,570
in particular, for a couple of reasons.

169
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,640
>> Pictured here is teaching fellow Alex,
who, apparently, shortly before he

170
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,810
took four pairs of CS50
Shades from a recent event.

171
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,810
But Alex has been an amazing
character to have on staff.

172
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,270
He was, shall we say, not
the greatest supporter

173
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,950
of CS50 coming to Yale
just over a year ago,

174
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,400
but he's turned into this extraordinary
member of our teaching staff,

175
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,490
an extraordinary Senior
in Computer Science,

176
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,280
and, and, and most importantly, number
one atop CS50's Big Board this year.

177
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,920
So congratulations to
Alex as well, here.

178
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,070
>> [APPLAUSE]

179
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,330
>> OK.

180
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,800
Fun fact, so with Rob
Bowden back home, do

181
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,040
he and I run the Big
Board this past year.

182
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,730
And so Rob was so annoyed
that Alex had bested him

183
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,842
that we even did a random
audit of Alex's code

184
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:19,800
to make sure that it was consistent
with the problem set specification,

185
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,170
and indeed, he bested Andrew and
Rob here in this year's Big Board,

186
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,980
so congrats to him as well.

187
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,510
>> Some quick thank yous to the team
back home, Daven and Maria and Hannah

188
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,949
and Rob, whom we'll soon see.

And also, a number of
the full time members

190
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,614
who work largely back
home behind the scenes,

191
00:10:33,614 --> 00:10:36,930
Doug, who heads up our CS50 AP
program, Dan Armendariz, who,

192
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,260
with our friends at Cloud
9, took to the next level

193
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,880
our use of CS50 IDE this year, Colton,
of course, with whom we've started

our production team,

you see in exactly this

200
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,490
both in Cambridge and
now here in New Haven,

201
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,210
our own Zamyla, whom
if we enhance, looks

202
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:13,221
more like this on most every laptop
at office hours most every night.

203
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:15,970
And in fact, not all of the staff,
of course, could be here today,

204
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,090
but I thought what we'd do is
dim the lights for a moment

205
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,381
and allow the staff, both
from New Haven and Cambridge,

206
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,022
to offer some words of their own.

214
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,990
I love it.

215
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,170
I loved it when I was taking a class,
and I love it even more as a TA.

but it's really rewarding

217

because you get to teach so much.

218
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,810

opportunities on Yale's campus

to really get invested in teaching.

CS50 from the other side.

-I was surprised at how
excited all the students were.

people, like, recover, like,

a picture of Rick Astley
and are like, who is that?

00:12:40,616 --> 00:12:42,850
>> -Yeah, I wanted to give back
because I got a lot of support

248
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,780
DAVID MALAN: All right,
so you may recall

249
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,530
that we began this semester
looking at computational thinking

250
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,750
and solving problems more
efficiently while thinking

251
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,910
a bit more like a computer.

252
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,493
And rather than rehash something
like peanut butter and jelly,

253
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:57,850
recall that we had the phone book here,
we solved such problems as problem sets

254
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,920
on game of 15.

255
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,960
But we thought we'd try
something a little new

256
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,400
here, whereby we see just to what extent
this idea of thinking computationally

257
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,692
has sunk in.

258
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,400
Whereby we thought we'd try to
offer up, in the form a volunteer,

259
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,430
some instructions and see how
well we can all follow them.

260
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,900
And for this, I need
at least one volunteer.

261
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,390
If you might be-- I see someone being
tapped on the shoulder right there.

262
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,420
Does that qualify?

263
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,160
No?

264
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,314
No, all right.

265
00:14:22,314 --> 00:14:23,480
How about, OK, in the green.

266
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,260
Come on back.

267
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,380
Come on over.

268
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,740
So let's go ahead and do this.

269
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,950
I have some notes up here
that we'll work on together.

270
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:34,890
And what is your name?

271
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,540
>> ERICA: Erica.

272
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,040
>> DAVID MALAN: Erica?

273
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,580
All right.

274
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,690
Let me give you this.

275
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,455
Erica, nice to meet you.

276
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:43,095
All right, so in just a moment-- you
all should have a blank piece of paper.

277
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:45,720
If you don't, just scrounge around
and see if you can grab one.

278
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,309
And find a pen or whatnot.

279
00:14:47,309 --> 00:14:49,100
And we're going to try
something like this.

280
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,910
If you are comfortable
doing so, Erica, I

281
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:57,300
need you to describe what you
see on this opaque piece of paper

282
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,290
so that the audience here is
only going to do literally what

283
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,230
you say by following your instructions.

284
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,515
And then in just a
moment, I'll come around

285
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:06,320
and take a random
sampling of some pictures

286
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,260
and we'll see just how accurately
your classmates have done.

287
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,770
>> ERICA: OK.

288
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,210
>> DAVID MALAN: Make sense?

289
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,580
>> ERICA: Yeah.

290
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:09,830
>> DAVID MALAN: All right.

291
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,705
So you at this point,
as the audience, should

292
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:13,750
have a blank piece of
paper, a pen or pencil,

293
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,780
and you should do
exactly what Erica says.

294
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,972
Go.

295
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:19,180
ERICA: Landscape orientation.

296
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:22,180

297
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:28,410
In the center of both the vertical
and horizontal axis of the page,

298
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:35,006
draw a square, not a rectangle, even
sides, about one inch on each side

299
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:37,380
with the center of the square
in the center of the paper.

300
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,340

301
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,530
Directly above-- thinking landscape
orientation-- above that square

302
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,290
but touching it, you should have
a circle with the same radius

303
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,010
as half of the side of the square.

304
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,400
So the circle should be able
to fit inside the square

305
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,930
and be just touching the top
of the middle, the middle

306
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,190
of the top side of the square.

307
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:07,480

308
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,770
And then directly below the square,
you should have an equilateral triangle

309
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:25,062
with one top point touching the bottom
of the square and then equilateral.

310
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:26,020
DAVID MALAN: All right.

311
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,519
So that was extraordinarily precise.

312
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,650
Let me leave you here
for just a moment and see

313
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,050
if we can get a couple of answers.

314
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,920
Can I grab yours?

315
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,500
OK.

316
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,366
Grab yours, yours.

317
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:40,990
Now I'm going to fish for one--
I don't know, that's very good.

318
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,150

319
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:48,032
You're all very good at this.

320
00:16:48,032 --> 00:16:49,400
Can I take this one?

321
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,130

325
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,200
Can I take yours, too?

326
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,160

327
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,330
No, that's a compliment.

328
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,842
OK, yes very good.

329
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:04,790
Thank you.

330
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,390
All right.

331
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,250
And just so I don't
neglect anyone over here.

332
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,390
That's very good, OK.

333
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,589
OK, that's adorable.

334
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,220

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,345
That's enough for this one.

336
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:16,720
So let's see how we did here.

337
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,890
>> All right so why don't
we go ahead now and I

338
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:26,190
will spoil, with Erica still here,
what the image was supposed to be.

339
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,230
Wonderfully, precisely
described, I would argue.

340
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,390
Now let me go ahead and take a look
at a random sample of the pictures

341
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,430
that we found up here.

342
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,020
>> So let's go.

343
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,880
The first several I
found were-- here's one.

344
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,280
So very nicely done.

345
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,330
Here's another, very nicely done.

346
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,670
Here's another, and this is where it
was getting awkward because there's

347
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,300
like 50 or a 100 of these out there.

348
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,830
But then I kept searching
and we found this.

349
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,060
So the orientation wasn't quite right.

350
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,220
Another correct one.

351
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,460
We had this one, all
right, so not quite right.

352
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,340
Then there's this one,
maybe not quite to scale.

353
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,420
And then the adorable one,
if I may, very nicely done.

354
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,770
>> Congratulations to Erica
for doing such a good job.

355
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,080
Thank you.

356
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,170
Why don't we get-- can we get one more
volunteer to come and do the same?

357
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,757
Come on up, yeah.

358
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:32,840
And I'm sorry for taking
the papers from everyone.

359
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,300
If you can try to
scrounge one other piece,

360
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,050
we'll do this once
more in this direction.

361
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:37,500
>> What is your name?

362
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,170
>> ADAM: Adam.

363
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,920
>> DAVID MALAN: Adam.

364
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,220
Come on up.

365
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,720
All right.

366
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,060
So the task is going to be very
similar, different picture.

367
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,768
Nice to meet you.

368
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:46,030
Come on around.

369
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,530
All right.

370
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,363
And we're going to do this again,
this time with a different picture

371
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:50,590
from Adam.

372
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,810
Adam is going to describe to
you, opaquely-- show confidence--

373
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,785
the following.

374
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:57,950
The floor is yours.

375
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,700

376
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,580
>> ADAM: It is a very large square.

377
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,420
Can I say that?

378
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,670
>> DAVID MALAN: Yes, that's good.

379
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,360
That's correct.

380
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,710
>> ADAM: But very large, like.

381
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,777
But start at the center--
like, from the center,

382
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,610
but it like expands
outward from the center.

383
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,430
So like, the center of the page is
still the center, so keep that in mind.

384
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,390
>> [LAUGHTER]

385
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:30,020
>> Then, divide it in half, but like,
in the center, going hot dog style.

386
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,870
Yeah.

387
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,080
Like.

388
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,920
So then divide it that way,
like up and down, vertical.

389
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,370
Vertical.

390
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,660
And then from the vertical
line, going from the right side

391
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,050
of the center of that
vertical line, go to the right

392
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,480
to divide that rectangle
on the right side in half.

393
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,930
OK.

394
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,260
>> So, but now, it's going to get a
little tricky, so let's hold on here.

395
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,290
You're going to do that
again, but going up from that.

396
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,940
So now you should have a rectangle, a
big rectangle, and two small squares

397
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,900
on the other side.

398
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,570
And then divide your
square in the top right

399
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,800
in half the same way you divided
the big square at the beginning.

400
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,460
OK.

401
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:12,960
OK.

402
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,930

403
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:19,070
Now, so now you have that square
that's divided into two rectangles.

404
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,670
And then draw that same line you
drew at the beginning from the center

405
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,546
point of the original square
with that line in the center

406
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:32,800
to the far-- horizontally from
that new up and down line.

407
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,770
And then recreate that square again
in the top right hand quadrant.

408
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,944
I mean, not the quadrant, whatever
the eighth is of a quadrant.

409
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:43,360
DAVID MALAN: I'm going to go
start getting the sheets, OK?

410
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,943
ADAM: Yes, OK.

411
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,999
So if there's any questions,
I can take those now.

412
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:48,790
DAVID MALAN: Can I see
just a few examples?

413
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,625
All right, we got this one here.

414
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,590
All right, this one here.

415
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,410
All right, still working.

416
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,780
Very nice.

417
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,280
Yes.

418
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,655
>> ADAM: I'm not good at this class.

419
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:59,210
DAVID MALAN: Thank you.

420
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,280
Yeah.

421
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:00,860
OK.

422
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,750
Let me take these two.

423
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,720
Thank you.

424
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,990
All right, and one more from over here.

425
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,720
One more from over here.

426
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,269
Thank you.

427
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,060
Oh, that's perfect.

428
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,590
Thank you.

429
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,590
All right.

430
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,580
>> So Adam, let's see how they did.

431
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:20,240
And I'll reveal on the screen
what the image was this time.

432
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,430
So what we were looking for this
time, per Adam's precise instructions,

433
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,040
was this.

434
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,570

435
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:38,360
And what we got was some works
of beauty here, I will say.

436
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,685
>> ADAM: Oh, I-- wow.

437
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:40,935
DAVID MALAN: You're surprised?

438
00:21:40,935 --> 00:21:44,280
[LAUGHTER]

439
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,450
Then we have this one.

440
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:49,710
So similar in spirit, but not quite.

441
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:53,150
Then we have this windowed version.

442
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,420
And then this one.

443
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,562
>> [LAUGHTER]

444
00:21:59,562 --> 00:22:01,020
And then this is maybe my favorite.

445
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,600
This one's just a little skewed.

446
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,160
>> ADAM: That one's not my fault.
That one's not my fault.

447
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,610
>> DAVID MALAN: Well all right,
thank you and congrats to Adam

448
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,890
for being so precise.

449
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,000
>> ADAM: Thank you.

450
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,770
>> DAVID MALAN: So why don't we
try this at least one more time

451
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,180
but kind of flip things around.

452
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,160
So now we need someone who's
comfortable drawing and having a hundred

453
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,050
of your classmates staring down
at your back while you draw,

454
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:24,291
taking instructions
from your classmates.

455
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,290
OK, how about in purple.

456
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,360
Come on up.

457
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,580
All right.

458
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,735
So in a moment-- what's your name?

459
00:22:30,735 --> 00:22:31,360
ANGELA: Angela.

460
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,840
DAVID MALAN: Angela.

461
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,666
Come on up, Angela.

462
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:35,790
So Angela's going to stand roughly
here, where she shouldn't be able to see

463
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,300
the overhead, she can
only see the board's.

464
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,465
Nice to meet you, Angela.

465
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:40,590
Here's your piece of chalk.

466
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,700
I'm going to show the
audience the picture

467
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,420
and then roughly orderly,
kind of like the PBJ,

468
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,500
we'll have you guys shout out,
linearly, exactly what you

469
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,100
would like Angela to draw.

470
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,302
Sound good?

471
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:55,240
Good.

472
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,314
Yeah.

473
00:22:57,314 --> 00:23:01,720
>> Would someone like to offer
an instruction to Angela?

474
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,353
It's not that-- well, OK.

475
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,052
>> AUDIENCE: Circle?

476
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,306
At the top of the board.

477
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:09,930
DAVID MALAN: All right, I heard
circle at the top of the board.

478
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,360
AUDIENCE: It's a stick figure.

479
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,194
DAVID MALAN: OK I heard
it's a stick figure.

480
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:16,318
And here, you want to hold
this in your other hand?

481
00:23:16,318 --> 00:23:16,960
OK, next?

482
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,730
>> ANGELA: Stick figure, all right.

483
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,979
>> DAVID MALAN: Draw a circle
in the center of the board.

484
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:22,100
It's a stick figure.

485
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,600
Stop!

486
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,100
Stop!

487
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,300
Stop!

488
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,577
Only keep the body.

489
00:23:27,577 --> 00:23:28,910
ANGELA: So it's like a lollipop?

490
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:32,950

491
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,450
DAVID MALAN: Add the two legs first.

492
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,780
ANGELA: Down here.

493
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,090
DAVID MALAN: OK, I heard yeah.

494
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,150

495
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:43,924
>> ANGELA: So here?

496
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,340
DAVID MALAN: The arm starts
from the body toward the head.

497
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,090
ANGELA: Like that?

498
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,384

499
00:23:52,384 --> 00:23:53,320
What?

500
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,400
>> DAVID MALAN: OK, here,
wait, how about this.

501
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,275
One arm goes up.

502
00:23:55,275 --> 00:24:00,860
>> AUDIENCE: The right arm has the
hand on the hip and the other arm--

503
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,680
>> DAVID MALAN: The right arm has-- I heard
the right arm has his arm on his hip.

504
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,596
>> ANGELA: His right arm?

505
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:08,970
>> DAVID MALAN: His right.

506
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,064
>> ANGELA: Like that?

507
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:12,000
>> DAVID MALAN: Yes.

508
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,915
What else?

509
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:14,160
>> AUDIENCE: The other arm--
The other arm goes up.

510
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,618
>> DAVID MALAN: The other arm goes up.

511
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:18,130
ANGELA: Oh, like that?

512
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,997
>> DAVID MALAN: All right, and--

513
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:21,330
AUDIENCE: He's saying something.

514
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,700
DAVID MALAN: He's saying something.

515
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,093
ANGELA: Like a speech bubble?

516
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:29,530
There's a line, approximately
10:00, that goes out from the head.

517
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,460
A line at 10:00 position that you draw,
like, from the radius, projecting--

518
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,418
>> [LAUGHTER]

519
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:38,404
>> ANGELA: Like?

520
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:41,370
>> AUDIENCE: No!

521
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,360
>> DAVID MALAN: There's a line
at 10:00 from the head out.

522
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,761
>> AUDIENCE: See like a line
coming out above the radius.

523
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:48,344
Don't draw it.

524
00:24:48,344 --> 00:24:49,840
Do what you did originally.

525
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,768
>> DAVID MALAN: Do what you did originally.

526
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:54,672
Yeah.

527
00:24:54,672 --> 00:24:56,100
>> AUDIENCE: He says hi.

528
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,160
>> DAVID MALAN: Write-- he says hi.

529
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,316
What do we think?

530
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:01,230
All right.

531
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,276
Congratulations.

532
00:25:03,276 --> 00:25:07,120
If you'd like to take a
look, you indeed got it.

533
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,460
Very nicely done.

534
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,517
>> So we've not try this last opportunity
before-- before we adjourn for cake--

535
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,600
but we thought we'd try
to get all the more of you

536
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,070
involved vs. Some of the staff as well.

537
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:19,620
And so, if I could-- are
there five staff members

538
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,610
who would like to volunteer
and come on over here?

539
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,540
Stelios, do want to bring
four friends on down?

540
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,280
From the staff.

541
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,980
Come on down.

542
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,560
Yeah.

543
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,631
Andy.

544
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:30,130
Yeah.

545
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,269
Come on down.

546
00:25:31,269 --> 00:25:33,310
And if you guys would like
to organize yourselves

547
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,040
in a line behind this blue table.

548
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,510
>> Now we need five student volunteers.

549
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,440
OK, so how about you two sitting there.

550
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,140
Three, four, in the middle.

551
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,160
Oh, and over here, five on the end.

552
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,660
Come on up.

553
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,810
Yep, you on the end.

554
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,450
Come on down.

555
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,700
And students shall be over here.

556
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,400
And-- did we lose some-- one, two,
three, four I pointed at someone

557
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,660
who still-- yes, you, you come on down.

558
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,740
All right.

559
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,110
>> So we'll explain the rules here if
you've not heard of this before,

560
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,877
but it sounds a little something like

561
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:09,370
>> [PLAYS THEME SONG TO FAMILY FEUD]

562
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:25,370

563
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,420
>> Aw.

564
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,050
OK.

565
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:30,550
So here we have Family--
Colton, website?

566
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,100
OK.

567
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,869
So here we have Family Feud.

568
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:34,160
And now you'll have to forgive.

569
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,810
You may recall that
in problem set eight,

570
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:38,430
we asked you a number of quiz review
questions that are kind of, sort of

571
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,260
in the form of Jeopardy questions,
even though it was question and answer.

572
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,190
We decided after issuing
p-set eight that we

573
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,981
want to play Family Feud instead,
so we've taken some liberties how

574
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,210
to convert Jeopardy
questions to Family Feud,

575
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,861
but the following data may or may
not be reflective of correct answers.

576
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:54,110
So with that, that said, the
way this is going to work

577
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,220
is that we have the student team here.

578
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,820
We have the staff team here.

579
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,180
We're going to first have two members
of the staff and students face off.

580
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,870
I'm going to ask a question and the
first one to buzz in with this here--

581
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,809
>> VOICE: That was easy.

582
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:08,850
DAVID MALAN: --Easy Button, which was
the only red buttons we could find.

583
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,800
And according to guy at
Staples, he has never

584
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,790
seen someone actually buy
the Easy Button in Staples.

585
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,640
>> That will be how the two people buzz in.

586
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,750
Whoever buzzes in first not only
gets a certain number of points,

587
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,349
they also get control of the board.

588
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:22,890
The goal, then, if the students,
for instance, win that toss,

589
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,080
you guys have to come up
with the top several answers

590
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,650
before getting three
strikes by guessing wrong.

591
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,240
I'll re-explain this as we go.

592
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,820
All right.

593
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,310
>> So let's go ahead and begin as follows.

594
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,290
What's your name?

595
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:36,790
VLAD: Vlad.

596
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,500
Vlad, all right.

597
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,240
Nice to meet you.

598
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,740
And introduce yourself to this team.

599
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,320
>> SHREYAS: Shreyas.

600
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,195
>> DAVID MALAN: Shreyas.

601
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:44,340
So here we have two Easy
Buttons, one question,

602
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,150
and the following will be revealed
now by Colton, A function declared

603
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,560
in standard io dot h.

604
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,100

605
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,980
>> VOICE: That was easy.

606
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,800
>> DAVID MALAN: You hit it first
so we'll go with the staff.

607
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,660
>> SHREYAS: Print f.

608
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,410
>> DAVID MALAN: Show us print f.

609
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,312
>> [DING]

610
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,270
DAVID MALAN: Very nice.

611
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,406
So now the staff has
control of the board.

612
00:28:03,406 --> 00:28:05,280
Oh, and if we're going
to keep score, we need

613
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,250
someone who's really good at
arithmetic under pressure.

614
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,540
Really?

615
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,503
Really?

616
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:11,610
Really?

617
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,110
OK.

618
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:12,890
I saw your hand first.

619
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,400
Come on down.

620
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:13,850
What's your name?

621
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,240
>> DYLAN: Dylan.

622
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,250
>> DAVID MALAN: Oh, Dylan, all right.

623
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,250
Dylan, nice to meet you.

624
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,310
So if you could grab a piece
of chalk and to the left

625
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,730
and the right of the
stick figure, keep track

626
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,980
accurately of the following arithmetic.

627
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,610
The staff now have 68 points.

628
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,270
All right.

629
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,820
So next question, specifically
for Andy, is the same.

630
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,250
Andy, what is a function
declared in standard i o dot h?

631
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,620
>> ANDY: Scanf.

632
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,190
>> DAVID MALAN: Colton, show us scanf.

633
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:37,116
>> [DING]

634
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,490
Very nice, so an additional
12 points for the staff team.

635
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,270
Stelios, same question, A function
declared in standard i o dot h.

636
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:46,160
Just Stelios, please.

637
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,110
>> STELIOS: Put c.

638
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,860
>> DAVID MALAN: Putc.

639
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,530
Show us putc.

640
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,550
>> [ERROR BUZZER]

641
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,350
>> One strike.

642
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,610
Only two remain.

643
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:57,211
Staff, a function declared
in standard i o dot h.

644
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:59,747
>> STELIOS: I mean, it is.

645
00:28:59,747 --> 00:29:01,580
DAVID MALAN: Well, no,
it might be in there,

646
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,590
but these are only the top six answers.

647
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:05,665
Key detail-- that
doesn't mean it's wrong.

648
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:07,540
It just means it's not
among the six answers.

649
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,498
>> AUDIENCE: He's foreign.

650
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:12,064
DAVID MALAN: So it was
bad, just not wrong.

651
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,060
>> STAFF MEMBER: Getc

652
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,211
>> DAVID MALAN: Getc.

653
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,714

DAVID MALAN: We'll give it to you.

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,660
Fgetc.

656
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,790
Five points more on the board.

657
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,530
Staff, a function declared
in standard i o dot h.

658

>> DAVID MALAN: Two strikes.

662
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,687
Shreyas, you have one last
chance until the students,

663
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,770
simply by getting one of
the answers on the board,

664
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,480
has the chance to steal the points.

665
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,349
You can all--

666
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,390
STAFF MEMBER: Oh, can we?

667
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:38,970
DAVID MALAN: No, you cannot.

668
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,690
It's just you.

669
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,820
Just you.

670
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,667
>> SHREYAS: Is f open in standard i o?

671
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:44,750
DAVID MALAN: We shall see.

672
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,330
F open.

673
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,650
>> [DING] It is, for ten points.

674
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,810
Back to Andy.

675
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:50,420
Make or break here.

676
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,855
Function declared in standard i o dot h.

677
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:54,000
>> ANDY: F close.

678
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,774
>> DAVID MALAN: Show us f close.

679
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:56,600
>> [DING]

680
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,395
>> Very nice.

681
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,050

682
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,330
Six?

683
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,080
We have only five.

684
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,070
We only have five answers
on the board, which

685
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,860
means the staff has won this category.

686
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,380
Very nice.

687
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,240
No it's lack of feature.

688

So these points stay on this side.

760

>> I think we have time for
one more round before cake.

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,980
Yes Yeah, skip.

763
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,760
Break, quick.

764
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,130
OK.

765
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,120
We didn't want to do that
to you one last time.

766
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,620
All right.

767
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,090
So the final question here
now for Stelios, thank you.

768
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,252

>> [ERROR BUZZER]

>> I will say, based on actual
data from problem set eight,

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,777
so p set eight was not among the
top four answers in this case.

790
00:33:28,777 --> 00:33:29,485
What's your name?

791

All right.

799
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,420
What do you have for your
favorite problem sets.

800
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,100

801

>> Very nice.

808
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,890
There's only one answer
left on the board

809
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,420
because we did the top four answers.

810
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,850
So if-- what's your name again?

811
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,170

Bonnie, if you can tell us what the

814
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,600

>> BONNIE: I feel like I
have a really skewed view.

>> VLAD: The one with image processes?

817
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,880
BONNIE: No I think
everyone hated that one.

818
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,570
VLAD: Really?

819
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,092
I loved it.

820
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:27,800
DAVID MALAN: And what
our current totals?

821
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,840

822
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,670
166 to slightly less.

823
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,719

Don't put the pressure on me.

Oh, no pressure.

828
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:47,379
STUDENT: P set one was easy.

829
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,310
Everyone likes easy p sets.
