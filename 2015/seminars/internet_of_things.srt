00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:05,400

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,220
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: What's next?

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,310
We are going to spend the next
hour asking, and answering,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,840
that question, what's next?

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,180
Because as students, you all spend
a lot of time studying the past.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,900
You spend a lot of time
mastering the present.

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,650
>> But asking, and answering,
the question, what's next,

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,970
is what's going to make you successful.

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,280
Because if you can't answer this
question, you end up being left behind.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,720
>> Companies that can't answer
this question get left behind.

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,040
Individuals get left behind.

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,200
Asking, and answering,
the question, what's next,

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,500
is probably the most important skill
that you will develop in your career.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,830
>> You only have to get it
right once, and you're done.

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,290
So we are going to ask this question.

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,710
But in order to get there we're going
to study the past where people have

18
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,430
gotten that answer right and wrong.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,440
>> In the 1980s, the big
thing was hardware.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,300
In the 1980s, companies
bought room-sized computers

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,950
and hired rooms full of
people to program them.

22
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,480
And in the late '80s,
things began to change.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:22,290
>> The companies that weren't asking what's
next, IBM, DAK, Wang, Sperry, are gone.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,250
The companies that did ask,
and answer, what's next,

25
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,060
were the companies that survived
and thrived into the '90s.

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,200
And of course, what's
next, was software.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,950
>> IBM got that answer
wrong, and they declined.

28
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,900
Microsoft got that answer right,
and they owned the next decade.

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,010
>> Now, this decade, this
word decade is a hint.

30
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,170
This industry runs in 10 year cycles
that are as reliable as Moore's law is.

31
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,310
10 years is something being born,
and then growing into maturity,

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,979
and being the big thing, and
then going away rapidly, only

33
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,520
to be replaced by the next big thing.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,353
>> And of course the next
big thing in the '90s

35
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:06,190
was software, mostly
the operating system.

36
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,650
And the killer app was productivity,
both office productivity

37
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,660
and programmer productivity.

38
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,610
>> The company that owns that
killer app for what's next,

39
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,570
ends up being the
company that dominates.

40
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,470
And of course, that company
in the 1990s was Microsoft.

41
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,380
>> Now 10 years later, Microsoft
failed to ask, and answer,

42
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,494
the question what's next, because the
world changes reliably every 10 years.

43
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,910
And of course, what's next,
was the web and the killer app

44
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,200
was information retrieval.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,780
And Google had the best
answer for what was next.

46
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,640
>> Now, in 2007, everybody
thought the cloud was next.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,685
Amazon comes out with
Amazon Web Services

48
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:51,140
and everybody was betting on the cloud.

49
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,010
That's what's next.

50
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,250
But see, there's a problem with that.

51
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,880
It was too new.

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,190
No invention really becomes
important until it's 10 years old.

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,630
>> So in 2017, the cloud's going
to become really important,

54
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,300
but it's still not what's next.

55
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,700
I was a Google employee in 2009 when we
discovered the hard way, what was next.

56
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,610
Do you know?

57
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,994
>> So you've got to get used to
asking and answering this question,

58
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:20,660
or you're never going to get good at it.

59
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,820
And if you get good at it,
you're going to be relevant.

60
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,361
>> Can I hold the questions for the end?

61
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:24,870
Thank you.

62
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,120
You're going to be good at it.

63
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
Or you were going to guess?

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,740
What?

65
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,100
>> SPEAKER 1: Mobile

66
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,610
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: Of course.

67
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,330
Mobile.

68
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:33,250
Now, the way we discovered
this, is Larry Page

69
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,950
sent out an email that said,
hey, we have a big problem.

70
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,690
And he called a few of us together.

71
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,830
And he showed us the big problem.

72
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,400
>> He showed us the data.

73
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,900
And the data was frightening.

74
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,330
The data caused us to have
a near death experience.

75
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,040
The data showed that users that
use the iPhone-- the iPhone

76
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,260
had been out for two
years in 2009-- people who

77
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,010
use the iPhone don't use browsers.

78
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,930
They don't search the web.

79
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,220
They use apps that
search the web for them.

80
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,010
>> Imagine our fright as Google.

81
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,920
We made-- at the time we
made 97% of our income

82
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,490
on sponsored links and ads
viewed through a web browser.

83
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,450
If this iPhone thing
was going to be big,

84
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:23,170
if this smartphone thing, if mobile was
going to be big, we had a huge problem.

85
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,990
97% of our income gone.

86
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,670
Crazy.

87
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,040
>> What did they do about it?

88
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,530
A couple of interesting moves that
Google made in 2009 that you all

89
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,490
should be aware of, because if you
don't start studying this stuff,

90
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,540
you're not going to be able to get good
at asking and answering this question.

91
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,910
>> Do you remember back before
2009, if you Googled what time is

92
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,460
it in, say, Columbia, what's your city?

93
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,440
>> SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE].

94
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,610
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: I can't even say that.

95
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,040
>> SPEAKER 2: Bogota.

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,600
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: Bogota, Colombia.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,740
What did you get?

98
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,200
You got 10 blue links about
Bogota, Colombia, and time.

99
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,760
All of a sudden in 2009, you got
the time in Bogota, Colombia.

100
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,120
>> Make search more app-like was Larry
Page's marching order, and we did.

101
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,560
Now that's a big deal for Google,
because every time Google delivers

102
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,020
an answer, they don't get paid for it.

103
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,220
They have to deliver a link that might
be bought and paid for, or an ad,

104
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,830
in order to make money.

105
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,574
This was devastating to the business.

106
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,490
Second thing they did is they moved
the A-team from Search to Android.

107
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,239
And that's probably why Marissa
Mayer left the company eventually,

108
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,940
because that was a backup plan,
just in case this is important.

109
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,900
But when we looked at this--
at Google, we looked at this--

110
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,440
and not only were people using
apps, they were right to use apps.

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,520
>> You understand, apps are a
better way to search the web.

112
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,260
Your app searches for you.

113
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,690
>> You're from Brazil.

114
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,670
You're into soccer.

115
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,310
What's a better way
to get soccer scores?

116
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,610
Install a soccer app that specializes
in soccer-- oh, football, sorry--

117
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,240
that specializes in football?

118
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,010
Or search the web that tries
to generalize everything?

119
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,380
It's the app, right?

120
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,900
>> If you're a foodie, what's
the best thing to do?

121
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,730
Get an app that specializes in
all the information about food?

122
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,320
Or search the web through a
browser that is a generalist?

123
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,780
>> If you're a science
nerd, the science app

124
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,560
is going to outperform
the web every single time.

125
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,850
Our life flashed before our eyes.

126
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,120
>> But then, why, why did the iPhone win?

127
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,700
Why?

128
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,050
What was it about the
iPhone that made it special?

129
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,200
The BlackBerry did everything
an iPhone would do.

130
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,100
Windows CE did everything iOS would do.

131
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,842
>> SPEAKER 3: Apple is a company
you can trust because they

132
00:06:42,842 --> 00:06:44,383
value the privacy of their customers.

133
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,640
JAMES WHITTAKER: Nope.

134
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,710
Apple has a lot of privacy data.

135
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,590
Why?

136
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,370
All those other phones, the BlackBerry,
Windows CE, PalmPilot, they all

137
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,660
did everything that
those other ones did.

138
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,570
What was it?

139
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,820
>> SPEAKER 4: Performance.

140
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,392
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: No.

141
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:01,350
SPEAKER 5: Good design?

142
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,340
JAMES WHITTAKER: No.

143
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,000
The App Store.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,040
If you wanted to get an app on any other
machine, any other handheld device,

145
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,720
before the iPhone, how
did you get that app?

146
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,300
You had to go to the web.

147
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,590
You had to know where it was.
www.whereinthehellismyapp.com.

148
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,650
And every single one of those websites
had a completely different download

149
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,020
experience, completely different.

150
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,640
>> Users couldn't navigate it.

151
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,739
No one ever installed
apps on those devices.

152
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:32,780
You couldn't update them.

153
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,520
>> And Steve Jobs came along
and said, hey developers.

154
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,280
I'm going to put your app where
customers can actually find it.

155
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,270
How does that sound?

156
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,670
Really?

157
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,740
You mean I can write
code and it'll be used?

158
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,920
Wow.

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,090
That's awesome.

160
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,090
>> And it was third party developers
that made that platform what it is.

161
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,090
The App Store was the killer app.

162
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,850
>> Now see, this is a hint.

163
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,280
Start watching for these gap.

164
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,290
Start watching for these holes.

165
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,050
From hardware to software, there
was a hole that was filled.

166
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,460
We can't program all these
machines individually.

167
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,470
One operating system to
rule them all worked.

168
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,230
The web.

169
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,380
>> We no longer have to distribute media.

170
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,010
We no longer have to update
software and ship it out on disk.

171
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,270
We can just push it through the web.

172
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,860
This is important.

173
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,180
And the App Store solved the
biggest problem in mobile.

174
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,110
And if it wasn't for the App
Store, it wouldn't have worked.

175
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,840
Right, because it drew developers.

176
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,070
And developers made the
platform what it is.

177
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,565
>> I'm going to take questions
at the end, is that OK?

178
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:35,429
Or I'm never going to get through this.

179
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:38,549
>> So what's next?

180
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,336
What's the 2020s?

181
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:41,867
>> SPEAKER 6: Nanocomputers?

182
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,700
JAMES WHITTAKER: We're
going to get to that.

183
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,360
Close.

184
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,960
>> Now, here's what we're going to do.

185
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,520
And I want to teach you
this because I think

186
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,540
this is the way to discover the future.

187
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,500
There was a bunch of gaps,
a whole bunch of gaps.

188
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,560
And you've got to get
used to finding them.

189
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,180
>> Every time your machines let you down.

190
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,940
Every time you think, why did I have
to click five times to get this?

191
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,420
Why is this functionality not there?

192
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,140
That's a missing link.

193
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,410
>> That's a gap that you
can step in and fill,

194
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,320
but only if you're watching for them.

195
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,730
Only if you look at the holes in the
existing technology as opportunity

196
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,800
instead, of something
that pisses you off.

197
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
>> So what's next?

198
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,490
Here's what we're going to do.

199
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,230
We're going to take a scenario, and
we're going to chuck it in 2020.

200
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,100
All right?

201
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,360
>> We're just going to take
a user scenario and we're

202
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,800
going to throw it into the
future and see what happens.

203
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,550
Have you ever seen this movie?

204
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,060
The best movie ever, right?

205
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,850
World War Z.

206
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,620
>> It's the best movie
ever for two reasons.

207
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,620
First, it's got zombies.

208
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,530
And zombies are real, right?

209
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:50,710
Not like that bullshit vampire stuff
we had to put up with a few years ago.

210
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,310
Vampires are made up.

211
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,040
They're not real, they never will be.

212
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,300
But they were kind of sexy,
so we watched them anyhow.

213
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,590
>> But zombies, people, zombies are real.

214
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,010
We can mathematically define this virus.

215
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,230
It's just a matter of time.

216
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,610
It's like your civic duty to watch
every single one of these movies.

217
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,140
So that I don't have to kill
you during the apocalypse.

218
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,890
>> Second reason it's the best movie ever
is because it's got Brad Pitt in it.

219
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,340
It's like zombie movie meets
date night, and there we were.

220
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,147
I'm going, oh, zombies.

221
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,480
And she's sitting next to me
and she says, Oh Brad Pitt.

222
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,000
Somebody told her about the shirtless
scene and she couldn't wait.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,910
>> But then something strange happened,
my date pulls out her phone

224
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,820
and begins to share screen time.

225
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,060
She's like, oh Brad Pitt, add
something on-- oh, Brad Pitt.

226
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,490
And I'm thinking, what's going on here?

227
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,860
What part of shirtless Brad
Pitt does she not understand?

228
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,180
>> And then, it got worse.

229
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,190
She taps me on the knee and
said, I'll be right back.

230
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,530
And she walks out of the theater
during this most perfect movie.

231
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,450
I'm stunned.

232
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,320
I'm flabbergasted.

233
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,540
I'm coming up with break up lines, man.

234
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,170
This is crazy.

235
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,020
>> Finally, she comes back, she sits down.

236
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,600
She's gone two, three minutes.

237
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,780
And she's in a huff, right,
she's clearly hurrying.

238
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,780
And I'm waiting for it, right.

239
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,070
Waiting for it.

240
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,570
Come on.

241
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,300
Say it.

242
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,670
You missed part of the movie.

243
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,790
Say it.

244
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,800
>> And she didn't say it.

245
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,970
She didn't say, what happened?

246
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,140
What did I miss?

247
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,150
So I thought, all right,
I'll be proactive.

248
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,840
So I said, hey, you
didn't miss anything.

249
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,080
And she said, I know.

250
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,520
>> Because she has an app that tells
her when to pee at the movies.

251
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,810
There is an app for that.

252
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,940
Someone has watched every single
minute of every single movie,

253
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,180
and they curated it all.

254
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,430
Right?

255
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,680
>> Oh, there's an action sequence
you don't want to miss.

256
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,860
Don't pee during that one.

257
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,150
New character, don't
pee during that one.

258
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,025
But here's four minutes, right in
the middle, nothing really happens.

259
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:42,640
Go take a leak.

260
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,169
>> Now I ask you all, how many
of you all go to the movies?

261
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:46,960
Just raise your hand
if you're a moviegoer.

262
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,270
I think it's safe to say
we're all moviegoers.

263
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,880
How many of you all have this app?

264
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,230
One person.

265
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,790
I love it.

266
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,610
I do too.

267
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,670
Small bladder people.

268
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,882
>> Look at this.

269
00:11:58,882 --> 00:12:00,340
This is a gap.

270
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,280
Here is-- $1.98.

271
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,780
Right?

272
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:08,520
Your $0.99, my $0.99, and yet all
of you all are potential customers.

273
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,030
>> This is called the application
discoverability problem.

274
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,140
And it is the biggest technical problem.

275
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,490
It's taking down the App Store.

276
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,460
The App Store solved a huge problem.

277
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,110
You couldn't find apps on the
web, put them all in the store,

278
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,040
now you can find them.

279
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,880
Aha.

280
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,470
You can't find them again.

281
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,990
>> That is a big world changing solution.

282
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,130
So how should this work?

283
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,090
Let's cast this problem into the future.

284
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,920
How should this technology
solve this problem?

285
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,300
It should be that I'm sitting in the
movies, and I think, oh I've got to go.

286
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,900
And I say, oh I don't know,
Cortana, I have to pee.

287
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,370
Now, what does Cortana
have to do to help me?

288
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,760
>> First, Cortana has to
figure out what I'm doing.

289
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,010
Where is my user?

290
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,640
OK.

291
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,660
No problem.

292
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,820
Lat/long pair.

293
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,780
Easy to do.

294
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,000
Built in functionality to the phone.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,250
So now, Cortana knows
exactly where I am.

296
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,350
Where is that?

297
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,600
Looks up an address.

298
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,740
Maps that lat/long pair to an address.

299
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,460
Easy.

300
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,335
Built in functionality
on the map application

301
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:10,280
that is already on my phone.

302
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
No apps, yet.

303
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,060
>> And then, next, she's got to think, OK
what is he doing here at this location?

304
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,700
Microsoft Research has a
patent for geolocating you

305
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,120
off the face of the earth.

306
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,610
We know you're on the second
floor of that building.

307
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:30,640
Bing has every single floor plan in
most major cities, across the world,

308
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,520
as data.

309
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,020
OK.

310
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,560
>> You're in theater number four.

311
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,685
Let's see, now I can go look up on the
web what's playing in theater number

312
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:37,310
four right now.

313
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:42,920
Because I know he's watching movie,
he hasn't moved it in 30 minutes.

314
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,670
Cortana knows exactly what I'm doing.

315
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,880
>> And in fact, Cortana, probably
when I say, Cortana I have to pee,

316
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,520
she's probably going to know, right?

317
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,190
Because the last time she geolocated
me in a bathroom was two hours ago.

318
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,170
She's been living in my
pocket for two years.

319
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:04,120
She has my mean time to bladder
evacuation data down, right?

320
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,790
>> She's going to say, yes, James, I know.

321
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,220
I saw you buy that beer on the way in,
just wait a few minutes, I'll vibrate

322
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,050
and then you can go do your thing
and not miss any part of this movie.

323
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,750
>> Now what happened there?

324
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,610
There was no app involved in that.

325
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,380
We actually have all of the pieces
to solve this problem, right now.

326
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,990
So what can we infer about
the future based on this?

327
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,330
There are several things we
can confer about the future.

328
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:36,090
>> First is our technology doesn't
have to go to the web anymore.

329
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,840
We don't have to go to the web anymore.

330
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,340
Our technology takes us there.

331
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,070
The web is no longer a destination,
it's simply a data source.

332
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,190
>> The movie times are up there.

333
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,020
The pee times are in the cloud.

334
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,520
They're actually sitting in Azure.

335
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,940
All that data is already there.

336
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,730
The world is beginning
to turn into data.

337
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,250
Our devices are beginning to
process and calculate intent

338
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,330
almost better than we can.

339
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,030
>> Secondly, Search.

340
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,780
My machine searched the web.

341
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,802
Do you know in 2015 something
really special happened.

342
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:13,260
Now I'm not talking about bots,
I'm talking about machines.

343
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,130
>> Machines on the web originated
and consumed more searches

344
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,970
than humans for the first time ever.

345
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,640
In 2014, it was still
a human dominated web.

346
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,960
2015 it's a machine--
machines are equal.

347
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:33,770
2016, 2017, by 2020, the amount of human
generated and human consumed traffic

348
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,710
is going to be minuscule.

349
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,880
Our machines are going to
be consuming the web for us.

350
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,950
>> And then, finally apps.

351
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,960
Where's the app in this?

352
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,520
I don't need the app.

353
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,120
The app is a noun.

354
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,110
I only need the pee times, I don't
need all the trappings of it.

355
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,410
Give me the answer and I'm happy.

356
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,800
>> Why are apps nouns?

357
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,710
So you pay for them.

358
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,970
We're going to talk about
monetization at the end,

359
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,250
because making money gets
kind of scary in the future.

360
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:08,630
But we're going to talk about
it, because it's important.

361
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,380
>> Apps have turned into verbs.

362
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:10,880
Right?

363
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,741
My technology discerns my intent,
realizes I need something.

364
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:15,490
It's in the cloud.

365
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,350
It's on the web.

366
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,650
Crack the app open,
bring out the answer,

367
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,340
put it on my device
just in case I need it.

368
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:28,460
>> All of a sudden, a lot of the things
that we do are no longer human

369
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,410
generated.

370
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:33,530
The machines are beginning to take over.

371
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,540
So you said nanotechnology, I'm just
going to generalize it to machines,

372
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,340
but yes, a lot of them are
going to be very, very small.

373
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:46,510
>> So Microsoft, my boss came to me
summer of 2014, and he's like dude,

374
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,300
HR tells me you haven't taken
a vacation in four years.

375
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,820
Go on vacation.

376
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,570
>> And so I Binged it what
this vacation thing was.

377
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,680
And apparently, vacation is something
that people who don't like their jobs

378
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,890
do to get away from their jobs.

379
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,480
And that kind of pissed me off, right?

380
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I don't want a vacation.

381
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,240
So I decided, I want to write code.

382
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,380
And so I thought this whole internet
of things thing sounded stupid, right?

383
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,730
Nest a thermostat.

384
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,369
You can control it.

385
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,079
And it's better, some way, because
there's a machine doing it.

386
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,830
>> No, it's not.

387
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:19,859
Not in my house.

388
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,150
I am a Seattle tree hugger.

389
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,619
That thing stays off.

390
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,119
Put on a sweater and kiss my ass.

391
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,540
Or the lights.

392
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,750
I've got this light program on my phone.

393
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,020
I can do my burglar alarm.

394
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,400
It's harder to do the app than
it is to just go over and turn

395
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,920
the light on or turn the light off.

396
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:41,950
>> So I had this whole-- I call bullshit on
the internet of things kind of feeling.

397
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,520
So I thought, that's what I'll do I'll
investigate this internet of things.

398
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,890
>> I'll put a machine on the internet
of things that deserves to be there.

399
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,780
A machine that's got something to say.

400
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,980
A machine that's difficult
for me to manage on my own,

401
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,560
and I could use some robots to help me.

402
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,940
And so I put my hot tub
on the internet of things.

403
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,290
>> So Step 1 was my vision,
because I always like to vision

404
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,180
how these things are going to work.

405
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,430
My vision was that Amazon drone would
fly over full of hot tub chemicals.

406
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,210
And my hot tub would see it coming,
and open its lid automatically.

407
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,319
And we'd just shoot the chemicals
right in the-- so I thought,

408
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:20,860
OK first thing I'm going to do
is I'm going to open and close

409
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,325
the lid automatically.

410
00:18:22,325 --> 00:18:23,700
And that was actually quite easy.

411
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,610
A radio frequency controller on
the motor for my hot-- easy, easy.

412
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,920
I mean seriously, two hours.

413
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,780
Most of it was just hooking stuff up.

414
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,470
Four or five lines of code and I'm done.

415
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,800
And now I've got a little Windows
phone app I can open and close the lid.

416
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:44,090
>> Second, was-- actually second was not
any of that-- second was I thought,

417
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,530
I don't want that Amazon drone
squirting chemicals in if I'm in,

418
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,820
so I put in a level, a detector.

419
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,700
I can detect when a human gets
in, the water level rises.

420
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,880
>> And in fact, it turns out, I was
looking at the data, I can weigh you.

421
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,510
If you're sitting in my hot tub, I
know how much water you've displaced,

422
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,542
I've done the math, and I can weigh
you more accurately than a doctor can.

423
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:08,500
And I know if your head's
gone under, because I

424
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,840
have to estimate your head weight
because it's not under the water.

425
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,660

426
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,040
So if you go under, I
know if you're drowning.

427
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,740
This is totally cool.

428
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,110
I had a bug in that, my hot tub kept
thinking somebody was drowning and they

429
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,610
weren't.

430
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,340
I'm like, just go ahead drown,
I'm tired of this error message.

431
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,210
>> The next was checking and maintaining
water quality, that was the hard part.

432
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,830
That took me a good day and
a half to solve that one.

433
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,980
Because the way you check water
is you actually dip the water out,

434
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,790
and you put in these little
chemicals, and you compare the color.

435
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,330
And I don't have a
machine that can do that.

436
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,420
>> So I had to get a laser, and I
actually worked with a nanotechnologist

437
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,000
to do this.

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,890
Get a laser.

439
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,800
Shoot it through.

440
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:55,297
And you get the color spread on this
little backing piece of nanotechnology.

441
00:19:55,297 --> 00:19:56,380
I don't know how it works.

442
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,240
It gives me data and it allows
me to determine the color.

443
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,760
And then I can maintain
the water quality.

444
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,050
Very cool.

445
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,570
>> Next was reorder chemicals.

446
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,180
Easy.

447
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,680
Amazon makes buying things
from the web so easy.

448
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,640
Bless them.

449
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,940
So it can reorder chemicals.

450
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,560
It can monitor use.

451
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,540
It sends me a signal when somebody's in.

452
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,730
It monitors how often
people are in, and I've

453
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,680
gotten a bunch of data about that right.

454
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,520
>> I know how dirty you are
when you get in my hot tub.

455
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,850
Because I can check the
water before you get in.

456
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,100
I can check the water after you get in.

457
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,350
I know what you've done in my hot tub.

458
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,430
>> The amount of data you can
get from these machines

459
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,770
is pretty, pretty amazing.

460
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,960
It will troubleshoot itself.

461
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,610
>> So that's what I'm doing now.

462
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,460
I'm monitoring the voltage and trying to
figure out all the noise from the grid.

463
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,600
The Seattle grid is really spiky.

464
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Your grid is, probably,
really spiky too.

465
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
>> But I'm beginning to find the patterns
for when my seals are wearing out,

466
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,160
because when the seals
wear out, voltage spikes.

467
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,190
And it stays up.

468
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,524
So it's one of these-- you
can detect it over time.

469
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:04,190
I'm getting to the point where
it's going to be able to do that.

470
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,106
>> And then next summer,
I'm thinking 3D printing

471
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:08,940
is going to get good enough that
I can just print my own seals.

472
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,900
By the way, that's something
else that's happened in 2015.

473
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,520
Before 2015, we were only
3d printing in plastic.

474
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,310
This year we've added metal.

475
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,020
We've added carbon fiber.

476
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,060
We've added sugars.

477
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,870
We can print carbohydrates.

478
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,600
This is crazy.

479
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,225
>> SPEAKER 6: There scientists [INAUDIBLE]

480
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,894

481
00:21:27,894 --> 00:21:29,060
JAMES WHITTAKER: Absolutely.

482
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,890
And it's going to match your
DNA, too, so it's going to know.

483
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,240
Because, you know, medicine is
made for a six-foot tall white guy.

484
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,270
And so we're going to able to do
some amazing things with this.

485
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,180
>> Proteins are coming next.

486
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:48,030
We're almost to the point where we can
print cotton and fibers for clothing.

487
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,620
They're printing houses in China.

488
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,580
They're printing cars in North America.

489
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,770
And so I'm thinking I can
print a seal for my hot tub.

490
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,390
>> So now, the cool thing about
this is, when these hot tubs

491
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,330
begin to talk to each other,
because let's say you have a hot tub

492
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,510
and I have a hot tub.

493
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,434
And my hot tub might say, dude-- because
I get to design the hot tub protocol,

494
00:22:11,434 --> 00:22:13,350
and they're all going
to call each other dude.

495
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,830
That's just going to happen.

496
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,360
I guarantee that's going to happen.

497
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,240
>> It can say, dude, here's my data.

498
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,150
Here's my usage data.

499
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,420
Here's my chemical data.

500
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,270
Let's look at yours.

501
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,050
And they're going to compare notes.

502
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,710
And they're going to figure out what
the best data-- what the best chemical

503
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,960
concoction is.

504
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,380
>> This company makes the best chemical.

505
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,900
This company makes the best
chemical for the Northwest.

506
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,490
This company makes the best
chemical for a desert climate.

507
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,570
They are going to
figure all of this out.

508
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,010
And it's going to be amazing.

509
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,310
>> By the way, this is where
the advertising and marketing

510
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,610
economy goes away.

511
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,030
You can't advertise to machines.

512
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,350
And if we're right, and
if the machines really

513
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,330
are the next thing, what
are you going to advertise?

514
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,530
How are you going to say, hey, I
got some hot tub chemicals for you.

515
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,020
Look at these hot tub chemicals, man,
they've got dancing cats and stuff.

516
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,210
>> They don't care.

517
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,660
Machines are going to say, we know
the data, man, don't come advertising

518
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,580
to me.

519
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,120
And all the machines are
going to be in on this.

520
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes.

521
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,120
>> SPEAKER 6: One of the next things
is building personal apps for ads

522
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,130
so that they don't have to feel
like they're being marketed.

523
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,120
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: A couple slides
later, I'll talk about that.

524
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,079
Your refrigerator.

525
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,120
I'm building a new house.

526
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,520
I'm shopping for refrigerators.

527
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,280
Refrigerators.

528
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,320
You don't have to just
scan things in anymore,

529
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,180
like you used to have to keep the
barcode, so it knows you have chicken.

530
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,638
>> Soon as you close your refrigerator
door, a bunch of lasers

531
00:23:41,638 --> 00:23:45,480
start shining on your food,
figuring out what you have in there,

532
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,000
how long it's been in there,
and its chemical composition.

533
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,990
We're going to be able to
detect food that's gone bad.

534
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,750
And it's going to be able to
know what you have, it's going

535
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:58,491
to be able to cook, suggest meals.

536
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:00,740
Your toaster is going to be
on the internet of things.

537
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,670
What the hell's a toaster have
to say on the internet of things?

538
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,340
Actually, I think the toasters have a
lot to say on the internet of things.

539
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,600
But I think one is going
to be really interesting.

540
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,462
And that is end of life decisions.

541
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:13,420
Because one day, your toaster's going
to wake up and it's going to say,

542
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,003
wait a minute.

543
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:15,810
Something's wrong with me.

544
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,840
Ah, my data's off-- something's wrong.

545
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,120
It's going to go out on
the internet of toasters.

546
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,800
And he's going to say, dudes,
something's wrong with me.

547
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,390
What's wrong with me?

548
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,350
And these other toasters are
going to look at the data.

549
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,160
>> And they're going to say,
oh dude, you're dying.

550
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,370
Filament number four is wearing thin.

551
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,090
You're about to go.

552
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:39,420
And it's going to have to order
its own replacement toaster.

553
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,800
Is that sad?

554
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,780
That brave little toaster
is going to have to do that.

555
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,360
>> And the thing that I
think is going to happen

556
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,360
is, you're not going to
get a choice of toasters.

557
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,160
Your toaster is going to replace itself.

558
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,360
>> You're just going to get the stock,
gray toaster, because you don't care.

559
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,950
>> You have a pink Mac and cool glasses.

560
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:03,220
You're going to get a stylish toaster.

561
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,197
>> Your machines are going
to know what you want.

562
00:25:05,197 --> 00:25:07,780
They're going to know your income
level, and the neighborhood,

563
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,470
and what other type of toasters
those people are buying.

564
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,710
And they're going to
make decisions for you.

565
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,216
>> Now, people in my generation
are old enough to say,

566
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:16,840
I don't want the machines to take over.

567
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,173
I want to make my own decisions.

568
00:25:18,173 --> 00:25:21,209
And we don't matter, because we're
going to die sooner than you all.

569
00:25:21,209 --> 00:25:23,750
And you all are going to die
sooner than the next generation.

570
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,791
>> And the next generation's
going to say, you mean,

571
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:27,480
you picked out your own toaster?

572
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,850
That's stupid.

573
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,010
You drove your own car?

574
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,820
That's stupid.

575
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,830
Are you kidding me?

576
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,038
>> Your alls kids aren't going
to get driver's licenses.

577
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:37,880
Isn't that cool?

578
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,260
>> Clothing.

579
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,180
Clothing is going to self-market.

580
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,920
We're all going to have to dress better.

581
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,270
Because if I say, man, look at that
Microsoft shirt, that is awesome.

582
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,527
I want that shirt in my size.

583
00:25:49,527 --> 00:25:52,360
Now, I could come up to you, and I
can have this creepy conversation

584
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,295
about hey, man where did
you get that cool shirt?

585
00:25:55,295 --> 00:26:00,635
>> And all of this, or that thing is
going to be on the internet of shirts.

586
00:26:00,635 --> 00:26:03,010
And it's going to be able to
communicate with my devices.

587
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,350
I don't know how.

588
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,520
Maybe I do this.

589
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,100
Maybe there's a button.

590
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,360
They communicate.

591
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:16,040
>> And all of a sudden, I have one of
those 3D printing at home in my size.

592
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,640
And you get paid from that.

593
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,973
We're going to talk about how
to get paid from all this.

594
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:23,260
You just referred a shirt
manufacturer to a new customer.

595
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,509
You're going to get a
micropayment for that.

596
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:26,425
This is my prediction.

597
00:26:26,425 --> 00:26:28,990
Now, it doesn't matter if I'm wrong.

598
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,280
I'm trying to teach you how to ask,
and answer, the question, what's next?

599
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,510
I'm giving you example answers.

600
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,520
It may, or may not, work this way.

601
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,070
It doesn't matter.

602
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,070
>> What really matters is that you
get practice asking, and answering,

603
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,690
this question, what's
next, so you're ahead

604
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,590
of the curve, instead of left behind.

605
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,200
>> So these machines are going
to talk to each other, too.

606
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,305
Every time I go, my Microsoft
band-- whatever it is--

607
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:59,500
is going to know I'm
traveling in Europe.

608
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,800
And I'm over-eating.

609
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,320
>> And it's going to tell my
refrigerator when I get

610
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,160
home, hey man, this guy's unhealthy.

611
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,760
You need to make sure you just order
healthy food for him for a few weeks,

612
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,630
and let's get his
statistics back together.

613
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,130
They're going to talk to each other.

614
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,964
>> All of this traffic is
going to be going on,

615
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:19,713
and it's going to wash out everything
humans are doing on the web,

616
00:27:19,713 --> 00:27:21,560
everything humans are
doing with the cloud.

617
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,490
Our devices are going to discern intent.

618
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,266
And they're going to be
correct most of the time.

619
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:29,640
When they're not correct,
they're going to learn from it,

620
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,740
and they're going to
stop being not correct.

621
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,300
And within five years,
our machines are going

622
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:40,860
to know more about what we need
to do during the day than we are.

623
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,730
That's my prediction.

624
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,240
>> Screens.

625
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,990
What if we didn't need screens?

626
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,470
What if we didn't have to
carry these things around?

627
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,540
Because screens go away.

628
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,770
If our machines are
automatically discerning intent,

629
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:58,710
why do I need an input device
to tell them what I want to do?

630
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,370
Why do I need an output device
to look at their suggestions?

631
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:04,870
We're going to need it for a
while, because the machines are

632
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,720
going to be wrong.

633
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,440
The machines are going to say, hey, I
think this is your intent, am I right?

634
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,530
Then we'll need it.

635
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,984
But then, they're not going
to need that for long.

636
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,650
Or, they're going to say, hey,
there's a couple of choices here.

637
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,300
And then we're going to choose and
then they're going to learn from that.

638
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,230
And we're not going
to need that anymore.

639
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,470
>> If you take away this screen,
what happens to this machine?

640
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,310
The electronics in this
machine, without the screen,

641
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,960
are about the size of my-
glad I chose that finger--

642
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,452
about the size of my index finger.

643
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:35,660
Because if you take away
the screen, you take away 70

644
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,240
some odd percent of the battery,
because that's all it does

645
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,250
is service the screen.

646
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,520
>> Moore's law.

647
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,250
Let's push Moore's law a
few years into the future.

648
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,550
Instead of this machine
being this big, the machine

649
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,170
is going to be, in about
four years, the size of just

650
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,340
from the knuckle to the tip.

651
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,850
And in another four years,
just the size of my fingernail.

652
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,160
>> We can sew these machines
into anything, right?

653
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,150
You can have computers.

654
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,650
Do you realize that this Windows
phone I carry in my pocket,

655
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,720
and the smartphones you
all carry your pocket,

656
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,930
is more powerful than any
computer that existed in 1994?

657
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:11,080
In 1995, there were two that
gave it a run for its money.

658
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,340
1994, 21 years ago.

659
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,810
>> And so now, all this computing power
into the size of my fingernail.

660
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,050
You all understand Moore's
law is under threat.

661
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,680
Moore's law is going away by 2020.

662
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,760
We will no longer be able to
get silicon so thin that we

663
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,840
can continue to double the number of
transistors on it, and microprocessors.

664
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,770
How, or what, are we going to do?

665
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,800
>> We're already solving this problem.

666
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,710
IBM has produced-- IBM
remember them from the '80s?

667
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,240
They're coming back.

668
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,070
See, it's much easier to
come back from a long time

669
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,690
ago than it is to come back
from owning the last thing.

670
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,940
That's why I think Apple's in
trouble, because they're on top now.

671
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:58,410
>> A germanium silicon mix, which is
going to give a few more years of life,

672
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:04,410
maybe as much as a decade
of life, to Moore's law.

673
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:09,280
We're also looking at
graphene and carbon nanotubes.

674
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:15,660
Both of those are going to continue
Moore's law into the far future.

675
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,850
At least a future that is far
away enough to be unimaginable.

676
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,301
>> Machines are going to
get a lot more powerful.

677
00:30:22,301 --> 00:30:23,800
And we're not going to need screens.

678
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,550
The screens are going
to pop up anywhere.

679
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,176
And you all had HoloLens on yet?

680
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:34,930
HoloLens uses your brain, tricks
your brain into putting objects

681
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,490
that you think are real.

682
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,420
Because that's what
your brain already does.

683
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,140
>> I don't look like this.

684
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,780
I am your brain-- the way I
look is your brain translating

685
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:51,125
what the light is doing bouncing
off of my skin, and hair, well skin.

686
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:54,310

687
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,400
That's what HoloLens
uses to trick your mind

688
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,660
into seeing things that aren't there.

689
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,650
>> So we put a screen on the wall.

690
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,330
Although this is a
total bullshit exercise,

691
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,450
no daughter needs her dad to
figure out how to fix this.

692
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,480
That daughter's going to do what
everybody else does, and go to YouTube

693
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,910
to figure out how to fix this.

694
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,390
So I don't think I
believe that scenario.

695
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,080
>> But this is what it looks like.

696
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,510
It's not virtual reality,
it's augmented reality.

697
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,660
Screens can be anywhere.

698
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,130
You can work with this.

699
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,860
You can see a Word document
eight feet away from you, giant.

700
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,935
You can have a holographic keyboard
materialize and hover right

701
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:30,810
in front of you, and
with the special gloves,

702
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,740
it actually feels like a real keyboard.

703
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:36,830
>> The screens are going to
come when we need them.

704
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:41,070
And we're not going to need
them for most things, just

705
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,810
creative things, design things.

706
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,000
For the times when we are
intensely human, again.

707
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,650
Because that's my hope is that
the machines will get us back

708
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,670
to that intensely human place.

709
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,640
>> Now let's talk about money.

710
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,720
And again I'm going to talk-- I'm
going to go-- I might not be right.

711
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,600
I want you all to ask this question.

712
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,960
I want you all to answer this question.

713
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,970
But I'm showing you how to do it.

714
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,685
>> What about money?

715
00:32:09,685 --> 00:32:11,560
How are we going to make
money in this future

716
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,300
when our machines are
doing everything for us?

717
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,200
Well, let's take a look in the past.

718
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,592
How did we make money-- sorry, it's
not my fault Harvard doesn't have HDMI.

719
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:23,320

720
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,690
>> The web, how did we
make money on the web?

721
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:29,680
There's two words you're
missing web and ads.

722
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,690
>> Why are browsers still the
same as they were in 1994?

723
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,030
Do you all realize that?

724
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,130
Netscape Navigator in
1994, here's how it worked.

725
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,360
You invoked it.

726
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,570
And you got a rectangle on a screen.

727
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,910
It had a text box.

728
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,270
You clicked in a text box,
typed the search term,

729
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,160
hit Enter, and got 10 blue links.

730
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,460
>> That's the same way the Edge
browser, and the Chrome browser,

731
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,390
work 21 years later.

732
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,100
Exactly the same way.

733
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,910
Why?

734
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,670
No other piece of software works
the same way as it did 21 years ago.

735
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,515
And it's exactly the same way.

736
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:03,390
It's a little faster.

737
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,890
And it takes a few more
file formats, but that's it.

738
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,690
>> Why?

739
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,420
Because of ads.

740
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,960
Browsers are money
making little machines.

741
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,140
Because it's start,
stop, start, stop, right?

742
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,690
You have to type in search terms, get
a search, stop, opportunity for ads.

743
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,910
>> And then you go to a website,
stop, opportunity for ads.

744
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,760
Over and over.

745
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,210
>> It's like the NFL.

746
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,070
They only play for 10 seconds before
they stop for commercial break.

747
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,160
It's crazy.

748
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,500
Advertisers love it.

749
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,400
But it doesn't work so well
in the apps world, does it?

750
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,800
It's a lot harder.

751
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,730
There's not enough room.

752
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,290
>> Apps are more like soccer.

753
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,980
Where's the ads in soccer?

754
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,590
You can't stop a soccer game.

755
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,960
Go on, go on-- hey, time out, guys.

756
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,770
Aren't you all buggered?

757
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,650
Take a break.

758
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,870
That doesn't worked out way.

759
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,160
>> And apps don't work that way, either.

760
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,830
Because I got that food app, I got
that science app, for a reason.

761
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,100
I want to get work done using my app.

762
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,490
Ads get in the way.

763
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,140
So when apps came out, all
of a sudden, the ads economy

764
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,350
had to make way for
the purchase economy.

765
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:13,389
>> And for $0.99, forever, not
per year, but forever, you

766
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,270
can make those ads go
away, and people do.

767
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:21,031
The purchase economy is
beginning to really take hold.

768
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:24,239
And I think you're going to see it take
hold in some really interesting ways,

769
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,100
too.

770
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,010
>> If you look at my blog
on medium.com, I wrote

771
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,330
a blog post called Twitter is
stupid, which is kind of cool,

772
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,210
because it trended on Twitter.

773
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,790
Twitter is stupid, because
this is why it's stupid.

774
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,429
I tweeted this last year, or something,
traveling to Boston and New York City

775
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:41,929
next week.

776
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:45,110
Any locals who can hook me up with
some good live music recommendations?

777
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,929
>> I'm blessed with a lot of followers.

778
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,770
I've got a bunch of people
from Boston and New York City.

779
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,460
Nobody replied.

780
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,219
Nobody replied.

781
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,219
I got two favorites.

782
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,540
Why in the hell would
you favorite this tweet?

783
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,450
James can't find no music, asshole.

784
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,930
>> Are you kidding me?

785
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,140
So I thought this is broken.

786
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,090
Surely all of these places, all of these
live music venues in these two cities

787
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,160
have a Twitter account, right?

788
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,180
And so I looked it up, because
Bing's ingested all the Twitter data.

789
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,270
>> So I could use a few of the API
causes-- it's not even codes,

790
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,680
it's just making an API call.

791
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,140
1,500 of them.

792
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,910
1,500 Twitter accounts that
claim to be live music venues.

793
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,020
So I just wrote a little loop,
and sent this tweet to them.

794
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,470
Blast.

795
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,210
Four lines of code.

796
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,900
>> And then I waited.

797
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,320
I didn't have to wait long.

798
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,810
One minute, because every single
people-- all of them who care,

799
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,100
have a social media coordinator, with
three screens-- Instagram, Twitter,

800
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,460
Facebook-- waiting for customers.

801
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,100
>> And I'm thinking, what's wrong here?

802
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,710
Here I am in Twitter saying,
I want to spend money.

803
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,500
And here are other Twitter accounts,
I would like to take your money.

804
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,790
And Twitter's like, would you like
to see an ad for-- you're stupid,

805
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,760
Twitter, stupid.

806
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
>> How should it work?

807
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,450
It should work like this.

808
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,890
Left swipe, right swipe.

809
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,390
Data to tell me what I like.

810
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,910
Or am I connecting you
to the right people?

811
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,190
>> Let's see.

812
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,450
Hyatt Regency Boston says
they've got jazz music.

813
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,840
Jazz sucks.

814
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,820
Left swipe.

815
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,460
Holy.

816
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,540
The only people that like jazz are
people that play it, for goodness sake.

817
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:30,340
>> The Boston Symphony, they
got classical music now.

818
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,550
Now, now, now.

819
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,490
We legalized marijuana in
my state a year or so ago,

820
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:38,260
and all of a sudden, classical
music is sounding a lot better.

821
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,120
But I'm not yet stoned enough.

822
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,680
Left swipe.

823
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,840
>> Orpheum Theater in Boston's got
Cage the Elephant and the Foals.

824
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:51,130
Cage the Elephant is awesome rock
band from Kentucky, my homeland.

825
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,210
And I went to see this concert.

826
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,374
>> This is commerce.

827
00:36:54,374 --> 00:36:57,040
This is the purchase economy
that's going to begin to take over,

828
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,360
and Twitter is beginning to do this.

829
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,026
I don't know if my blog post had
anything to do with it, or not.

830
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:06,180
But you can now donate money to a
political candidate through Twitter.

831
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,010
>> They are finally beginning
to connect buyers and sellers

832
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:09,980
within their ecosystem.

833
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,470
And you are going to see this.

834
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,120
It's a massive threat to Google.

835
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,140
This is a massive threat
to anything that puts

836
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:20,120
ads in the path of buyers and sellers.

837
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,390
>> Facebook and Twitter did
this, they would consume much

838
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,030
of the purchase economy on the web.

839
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,790
>> Now what about when devices
start coming into play?

840
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,720
What about this scenario.

841
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,660
Cortana, I have to pee.

842
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,080
And I go.

843
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,140
And I come back.

844
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,300
How about that?

845
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,820
How does this person make
money in this new economy?

846
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,100
>> I think it's subscriptions
and micro payments.

847
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,800
That data is in Azure.

848
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,570
That developer pays a subscription
to be an Azure customer.

849
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,910
>> So do a million other, I think
Microsoft announced last week

850
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,350
a million paid accounts in
Azure, or something like that.

851
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,050
So a lot of money in the ecosystem.

852
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:07,040
>> So when Cortana sees me go and
consume third-party content,

853
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,899
a micropayment will be made.

854
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:09,940
This makes perfect sense.

855
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,900
The subscription money
is already out there.

856
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,470
>> You all have subscript-- you're paying
subscriptions to Spotify, and Netflix,

857
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:20,010
and Comcast, or Time Warner, or whoever
whatever lousy cable company you all

858
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,980
are stuck with.

859
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,830
I know they're lousy,
because they're all lousy.

860
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,120
>> In order to get from one
Game of Thrones episode

861
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,930
to the next Game of Thrones episode
on my Comcast box, it's 21 clicks.

862
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,480
Are you kidding me?

863
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,440
That's an opportunity.

864
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,910
>> So for a cent, maybe you watch
World War Z. That's a $0.04 pee.

865
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,880
A three hour Hobbit
movie, that's a $0.28 pee.

866
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,890
The premiere of Star
Wars, that pee's $1, man.

867
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,260
>> So now, instead of you and I, the
two lone people who got this app,

868
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,340
makes a couple of dollars, or he
makes money on every single customer.

869
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,930
This is the economy that's coming.

870
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:11,890
Every single, possible customer, when
they consume your value, you get paid.

871
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,190
>> Now this, you need to
think about very carefully.

872
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,660
Because I think this is
the future of making money.

873
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,070
It's your ability to inject
value into the ecosystem.

874
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,675
The more the value gets consumed,
the more money you're going to make.

875
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:33,410
>> SPEAKER 6: What about RPGs
and buying virtual products?

876
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,410
JAMES WHITTAKER: That's
purchase economy, right?

877
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,510
And that's already taking
place, so it's now.

878
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,470
>> Now, what about things?

879
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:46,590
When these machines really begin
to start doing real things for us,

880
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:49,210
it adds one more additional
way of making money.

881
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,720
And that's sharing.

882
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,870
Airbnb, we share our houses.

883
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:54,470
Uber, we share our cars.

884
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,430
>> Do you know there's an Airpnp?

885
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,010
Have you ever been driving,
and go, god, I got to go?

886
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,090
Why do all my examples
have to do with urination?

887
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,260
God, I got to go, right.

888
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,340
And you're driving by all
these houses, with toilets.

889
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,320
It's a buck and a half to
go pee at somebody's house.

890
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,650
And then they can rate you, so
you can't-- it's got to be clean.

891
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,170

892
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,129
>> So sharing comes about.

893
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:22,003
In fact, I'm going to
do that for my hot tub.

894
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:25,300
It's going to rent itself out, because
it's completely self-maintaining now.

895
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,480
$100 an hour, it's going
to rent itself out.

896
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,630
So anyhow, if you're in
Woodinville, Washington, next year,

897
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,260
and you need a soak--

898
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,020
>> [THKK]

899
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,340
>> Now, what about when
the machines take over.

900
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:43,100
Because if you listen to people like Ray
Kurzweil, and Bill Gates, and Stephen

901
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,440
Hawking, and Elan Musk, everybody's
worried about this thing

902
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,370
they call the singularity, the
point at which the machines get so

903
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:54,420
smart that they don't need us anymore.

904
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,130
>> Now we've got a long way to
get there, but on the way,

905
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,800
we are going to become
less and less relevant.

906
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,310
You understand that our industry has
destroyed a lot of other industries.

907
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:07,080
The video rental industry, gone.

908
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,180
>> The photography industry, gone.

909
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,080
Eastman Kodak used to
employ hundreds of thousands

910
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,020
of people, and millions
of ancillary jobs,

911
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:21,970
and taking pictures and developing film,
and wedding photographers, all of that

912
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,860
billions of dollars concentrated
into the 13 employees of Instagram.

913
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:34,510
>> We are really good at destroying
jobs and making it harder and harder

914
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,610
and harder for people to make money.

915
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,690
So what happens when the
machines start doing everything?

916
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,030
What then?

917
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,810
>> Because you know what?

918
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,160
They're going to be
better at it than we are.

919
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,570
There is going to come a day, in the
very near future, when you will not

920
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,120
get on an airplane if there's
a human in the cockpit.

921
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,760
Too dangerous.

922
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,880
I don't know if that person
is taking their meds.

923
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,814
No way.

924
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:59,230
There's going to come a day,
not too distant future, where

925
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,570
it will be illegal for
a human to drive a car

926
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,232
because the machines
are a lot better at it.

927
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,940
They're going to be
better at everything.

928
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,120
They're going to be better at building.

929
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,703
They're going to be better at driving.

930
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:12,720
They're going to be better
at paving our roads.

931
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,140
They're going to be better
at designing traffic flows.

932
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,431
They're going to be better
at designing traffic lights.

933
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:21,650
They're going to be better
than us at all of this.

934
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,360
>> So what do we do?

935
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:27,280
When the number of jobs that we
can do better than machines are,

936
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,806
OK, I'm going to have to
take this question, aren't I?

937
00:42:29,806 --> 00:42:31,847
SPEAKER 6: Machines don't
have feelings, and they

938
00:42:31,847 --> 00:42:35,807
have no desire to do certain
things, nor can they handle things.

939
00:42:35,807 --> 00:42:38,432
JAMES WHITTAKER: They can't desire
if they don't have feelings.

940
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:39,140
SPEAKER 6: Right.

941
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,768
So they don't handle things
like interpersonal interactions,

942
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,310
there's going to be more jobs
for people like psychologists--

943
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,143
JAMES WHITTAKER: OK.

944
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,770
You're a little bit ahead of me, again.

945
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,560
So bear with me.

946
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,680
I'm going to get there, I promise.

947
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,790
>> So what do we do?

948
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,640
Is that what we're left with?

949
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,540
Basically all just the human part?

950
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,700
Where we're philosophers,
and we're poets?

951
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:08,290
Is this why we're legalizing marijuana?

952
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:12,430
Are we preparing for this day
where basically it just, let's

953
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,260
think deep thoughts and get high.

954
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,580
>> Or it could be what you suggest.

955
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,526
It could be that the machines
give us back our humanity.

956
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:23,650
It could be that they take care of all
the things that we don't want to do.

957
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,570
So we can get back to being human.

958
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,340
>> But is this singularity going to come?

959
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,670
It might.

960
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,470
Our machines are
getting really powerful.

961
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:37,380
Why are they?

962
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,490
Why is it all of a sudden
that we're talking about AI?

963
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:43,676
Do you understand what's
going into this AI?

964
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:46,150
I claim it's not AI, at all.

965
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,740
I claim it's just code.

966
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,280
>> Look.

967
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,130
Here's why our computers, our
machines, are looking so smart now.

968
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,480
Number one is they got data
they didn't have access to.

969
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,840
Even a few years ago, they
didn't have access to this data.

970
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,050
Now, everything is born digitally.

971
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,600
Of course, they have the--
there's just that much more data.

972
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,136
>> Secondly, that data's
stored together, now.

973
00:44:08,136 --> 00:44:09,260
We don't really have a web.

974
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,100
You all understand the
web is already dead.

975
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,910
>> How many of you all have built a
web server, over the last year.

976
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:19,580
So this is the highest concentration
of web server developers

977
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,420
that will ever exist in a university.

978
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,900
If I had asked this five years
ago, every single one of you

979
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,590
all would be building
web servers every week.

980
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,274
Because that's what you did.

981
00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:31,940
You configured web servers all the time.

982
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,731
I had six of them under my desk
serving different kinds of traffic.

983
00:44:34,731 --> 00:44:36,490
That's not the web we have anymore.

984
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,680
The web we have now is data centers.

985
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,980
All those web servers have migrated
into the cloud, into data centers.

986
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:47,130
And so they're all together, which
means we can store contiguous data,

987
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:52,990
related data in the same place, and
off-line process the crap out of it.

988
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,030
>> Right now, no one's
searching for World Cup data.

989
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,940
And so all-- soccer World Cup, maybe
rugby but rugby is over now, too.

990
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:03,830
So all that's migrated to back end
machines, and now all this stuff--

991
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,590
>> We can push data that's more
popular different places.

992
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,490
And then offline, we
can say, OK hey let's

993
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,490
take a look at this World
Cup data, and see what

994
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:14,511
we can figure out, completely offline.

995
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:17,760
That's why it's looking so much smarter,
is because it's all sitting together.

996
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,380
And our machines are a lot
faster at processing it.

997
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:25,320
Vast amounts of data, well-organized,
and processed at speed.

998
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,570
>> And yet still, at some point,
we are going to figure something

999
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,610
out really important.

1000
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,900
And I think it's the
Human Brain Project.

1001
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,560
That's what we need to watch.

1002
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,970
Do you all know about
the Human Brain Project?

1003
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:40,150
>> Look, we mapped the human genome with
computers no more powerful than this.

1004
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,660
In 1990, the Human
Genome Project started.

1005
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:48,380
We mapped the genome of an arbitrary
human being in 13 years using computers

1006
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,900
no power more powerful than this.

1007
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,120
>> Now we have computers way
more powerful than this.

1008
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:57,160
And we started mapping
the brain two years ago.

1009
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,990
This is where our machines
are going to help.

1010
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:03,370
Our machines allow us to do this.

1011
00:46:03,370 --> 00:46:07,020
We don't map the brain
without our machines.

1012
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,360
And what are we going to discover?

1013
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,260
>> What have we already discovered
in just two short years?

1014
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,610
Two years into the Human
Brain Project, we're already

1015
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,860
hitting milestones at year eight.

1016
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,860
We know what depression looks like.

1017
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,940
We know what anxiety looks like.

1018
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:23,930
We know what bipolar looks like.

1019
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:25,890
We know what autism looks like.

1020
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,190
>> All of these things
are already mapped out.

1021
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,320
How much longer until our
machines look at this and say,

1022
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,840
I know how to cure anxiety.

1023
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,680
I know how to cure depression.

1024
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,590
Our machines are going to do this.

1025
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,230
And it's going to be stunning.

1026
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:45,000
>> So I think our machines
are going to allow

1027
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,430
us to do what we were meant to do.

1028
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,280
This, I think, is the fundamental
purpose for human beings

1029
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,980
is to explore, to terraform other
worlds, to reach other solar systems,

1030
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:03,520
to find other lives, to figure out
whether ancient aliens really is true.

1031
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,800
>> And we are going to slowly solve
every single mystery of mankind.

1032
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,930
This is what you all are going to do.

1033
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,170
This is what your
children are going to do.

1034
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:19,460
And over the decades, we will exhaust
every single mystery on the planet,

1035
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,110
and on other planets.

1036
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,580
And then what?

1037
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,580
This is the thought I'm
going to leave you with.

1038
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,710
Then we'll have questions.

1039
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:33,990
Perhaps, just perhaps,
using these magic machines,

1040
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:38,410
the power of our minds amplified
by these magic machines,

1041
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:42,860
we'll discover that we weren't
meant to go to heaven at all.

1042
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:47,010
>> But through technology, to
create heaven for ourselves.

1043
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:49,720
Perhaps, just perhaps,
the meaning of life

1044
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,860
isn't given to us by a higher power.

1045
00:47:52,860 --> 00:48:01,060
Perhaps, we use our technology
to evolve into that higher power.

1046
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:08,690
>> Perhaps, God, it is said,
created us in his own image.

1047
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:16,460
Maybe, through these magic
machines, we create god in ours.

1048
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,890
>> My name is James Whitaker.

1049
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,450
I work for Microsoft.

1050
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:20,097
Thank you.

1051
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:27,520

1052
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,130
Follow me on Twitter, if you'd like.

1053
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:32,780
The transcript of this is
on medium.com/@docjamesw.

1054
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,232
>> And I'll take questions.

1055
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:35,940
SPEAKER 7: So two
questions, first thing.

1056
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,780
When we're talking about--

1057
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,363
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: Oh, you're
getting a free question here, huh?

1058
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:42,710
SPEAKER 7: --App store
transforming everything.

1059
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:47,730
But Ubuntu had an app store that
looked exactly like the one from Apple.

1060
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,160
It was just for desktop.

1061
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,577
Why is it that App Store for
mobile is that life changing?

1062
00:48:51,577 --> 00:48:54,701
JAMES WHITTAKER: Because mobile, that's
where all the users were in mobile.

1063
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:56,220
Now there's a second piece to this.

1064
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,920
The second piece to this is Steve Jobs,
and his amazing storytelling ability.

1065
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,180
>> SPEAKER 7: Because technically,
the Ubuntu app store

1066
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,010
already solved the problem
of I have an app for--

1067
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,830
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: But there were
eight people with Ubuntu machines.

1068
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,890
And there were 200 million people with--

1069
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:14,530
>> SPEAKER 7: And that's the Steve Jobs.

1070
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,940
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: --iPhones
and that's Steve Jobs, right.

1071
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,050
But it was the developers, the
developers building functionality.

1072
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,960
That's why you all have
iPhones, and not the other

1073
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,480
because they've got the best app store.

1074
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,007
What was your second one?

1075
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,500
>> SPEAKER 7: About the future.

1076
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,350
I always wonder why people say
so much, internet of things,

1077
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,520
right now, because we
basically have the technology,

1078
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,020
we had this technology doing
most of this stuff like 10 years,

1079
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,420
or even 20 years ago.

1080
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,360
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: Ah, I don't know.

1081
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,500
We had the sensors, but the
data-- we didn't have the data.

1082
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,490
There wasn't anything
useful for them to do.

1083
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:50,040
And we didn't have the conductivity.

1084
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,530
Bandwidth is almost free now.

1085
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:53,030
So.

1086
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,170
>> SPEAKER 7: Does the data
bring that much into it?

1087
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,878
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: But
it's 10 year cycles.

1088
00:49:56,878 --> 00:50:00,350

1089
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,410
Everything that you all are
using right now is 10 years old.

1090
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:07,840
And what's going to be really big in
10 years has already been invented.

1091
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,720
That's why the cloud is
underpinning all of this.

1092
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,350
And the cloud was invented in 2007.

1093
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:19,101
So it takes a while for the world
to catch up with the technology.

1094
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:19,600
Yes, ma'am.

1095
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,173
>> SPEAKER 6: So, the Brain
Project, there are those people

1096
00:50:24,173 --> 00:50:28,542
in the field of psychology, who feel
that neuropsychology may turn out

1097
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:31,850
to be nothing more than phrenology.

1098
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:37,240
How do you think-- is it
possible to quantify and create

1099
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:42,180
algorithms, understand a state
of consciousness and intent,

1100
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,530
when we don't understand
what those things are?

1101
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,310
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: So I actually
think that the machines are never

1102
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,520
going to catch up to us.

1103
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,140
My opinion is that
gray matter will end up

1104
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:58,300
being triumphant over
germanium, silicon,

1105
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,252
carbon nanotubes, and graphene.

1106
00:51:00,252 --> 00:51:02,960
I think there's something going
on up here that's really special.

1107
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,660
I do think we're going to figure it out.

1108
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,690
I'm not sure we're going to
figure out how to build it.

1109
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,465
Yes, sir.

1110
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:11,882
>> SPEAKER 8: Who governs this?

1111
00:51:11,882 --> 00:51:14,840
If we get to a point where the machines
and our software are making all

1112
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:21,100
of these momentous decisions, does
that mean that at some point we--

1113
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,850
in our world where governance isn't
important anymore, and Google,

1114
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,830
Microsoft and international
corporations--

1115
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:28,580
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: That's why people
are signing all these petitions

1116
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:34,210
to create rules about never-- we've
already programmed machines to kill.

1117
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,620
We've done that, and the
machines have independently

1118
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:40,290
killed people, because they
are obeying their programming.

1119
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:43,380
>> And so, we can program them
to do anything we want.

1120
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,640
Where are those laws going to come from?

1121
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,480
Do people trust-- the companies
at the forefront of this

1122
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:58,560
are Microsoft, Google,
IBM, even Cisco, Tesla.

1123
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,330
Who are we going to trust?

1124
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,190
>> I mean, this is a
societal level discussion

1125
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,140
that really needs to take place.

1126
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:08,880
I don't have an answer for it, because
I don't think there is one yet.

1127
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,620
Donald Trump, Vladimir
Putin, they'll figure it out.

1128
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:17,470
>> [LAUGHING]

1129
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,930
>> I love blue states.

1130
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,740
We can laugh on things like that.

1131
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,190
Wow, I have to be careful
when I talk in red states.

1132
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,980
Any more questions?

1133
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,320
Yes, sir.

1134
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,390
>> SPEAKER 7: So when you
were talking about things,

1135
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:34,540
you know, if you went
to the movie theater,

1136
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:37,200
and you used the bathroom, that
a payment would already happen.

1137
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,230
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: Yeah.

1138
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:40,760
Money is going to be moving
around, so that micropayment,

1139
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,440
I am 100% sure that
that's going to happen.

1140
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,690
It has to.

1141
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,010
The App Store is breaking down.

1142
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:48,050
No one's making money in the App Store.

1143
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,780
And whenever no one makes money,
that's when change happens.

1144
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,727
>> It was harder to make-- easier to
make money on web than Windows.

1145
00:52:55,727 --> 00:52:57,060
That's when the transition went.

1146
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,393
When it was easier to make
money on mobile than the web,

1147
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,902
that's when the transition went.

1148
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,360
When it's easier to make money
in the cloud than on mobile,

1149
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,310
that's going to be the transition.

1150
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,140
It's capitalism.

1151
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,830
Did I get all your question?

1152
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,800
>> SPEAKER 7: So actually
it was more about-- does

1153
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,216
that mean you see the industry
becoming more consolidated?

1154
00:53:13,216 --> 00:53:16,685

1155
00:53:16,685 --> 00:53:17,957
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: At first.

1156
00:53:17,957 --> 00:53:19,290
But it's going to be a reaction.

1157
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:22,299
My prediction is, actually, that
it's going to be individuals.

1158
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,340
I don't know how long the
big companies are going

1159
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:26,730
to last because we won't need them.

1160
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,880
>> When infrastructure is
free, storage is free.

1161
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,380
Yeah.

1162
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,840
If you all need to go, you won't
hurt my feelings by filing out.

1163
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,090
But when storage is free,
when infrastructure is free,

1164
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,520
when networks are free,
when communication is free,

1165
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,050
there's no advantage to the
big conglomerates anymore.

1166
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,320
So it's an individual thing.

1167
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,153
>> It's your ability to
code, it's your ability

1168
00:53:45,153 --> 00:53:48,240
to code, it's her ability to code,
and inject value into the ecosystem.

1169
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,126
Because the infrastructure
is going to be free.

1170
00:53:52,126 --> 00:53:53,875
It could be a great
age of the individual.

1171
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:56,450

1172
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,056
Yes, sir.

1173
00:53:57,056 --> 00:54:01,190
So did you have the
grand scale of everything

1174
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:04,094
you covered, but I just
had a question about what

1175
00:54:04,094 --> 00:54:08,378
your vision for [INAUDIBLE], how to
interact with [INAUDIBLE] directly

1176
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,300
everything is totally taken care of.

1177
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,460
So you talked about
[INAUDIBLE] you'd have

1178
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,530
Word doc and [INAUDIBLE] over here.

1179
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,530
And so one thing I found about
physical [INAUDIBLE] systems

1180
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,911
is that some things are
evolving, like touchscreens

1181
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:25,202
are definitely getting way
better than they used to be.

1182
00:54:25,202 --> 00:54:27,243
Mice are getting way better
than they used to be.

1183
00:54:27,243 --> 00:54:30,986
But the physical keyboard
is actually pretty amazing.

1184
00:54:30,986 --> 00:54:33,967
And it's [INAUDIBLE]

1185
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,550
JAMES WHITTAKER: Is it, or is
it-- so I don't know the answer,

1186
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,380
but I want you to not get
lost in your opinions.

1187
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,640
Question that.

1188
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,300
Is it just your familiarity
with a physical keyboard

1189
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,090
that's creating this affinity to it?

1190
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:50,300
Or is it really something that is--
because we're very limited by it.

1191
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:53,580
This corded keyboard is actually
the wrong way to type fast.

1192
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,210
Artificially, slows us down
because the old mechanical things

1193
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,980
we needed to slow typists down.

1194
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:58,480
Right?

1195
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,680
I don't know.

1196
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,950
>> I think, I believe that
the machines are going

1197
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,200
to be able to figure out
intent really easily.

1198
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,080
If you're a writer,
you're going to need it.

1199
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,070
Right?

1200
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,752
The machines, those input devices,
are going to be for the creatives.

1201
00:55:11,752 --> 00:55:14,960
That's how we're going to know who are
our artists, who are our creators, who

1202
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,260
are our designers, and who are just
the muggles, that go through world not

1203
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,480
needing their machines.

1204
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,700

1205
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,910
>> Keep thinking about this, and
be careful of your biases.

1206
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,560
We all inject biases in this.

1207
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,936
I've got biases injected in this.

1208
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:33,435
That's why I warned you, this
is not what's going to happen,

1209
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,190
it's my opinion of
what's going to happen.

1210
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,480
I want your all's take away to be you
walk out of here thinking, what's next?

1211
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,177
What's next?

1212
00:55:40,177 --> 00:55:43,260
I want you cussing me in the middle
of the night when you wake up and say,

1213
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:43,810
what's next?

1214
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,270
Damn James.

1215
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,210
Asshole.

1216
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,030
What's next.

1217
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,980
Careful of your biases.

1218
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,600
>> Is there more questions?

1219
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,250
Yes, sir.

1220
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,798
>> SPEAKER 7: Earlier you talked about
machines being able to predict intent

1221
00:55:55,798 --> 00:55:56,760
and what people want.

1222
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,120
What happens-- will they be able to know
when people want to change their minds

1223
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,910
or trying something new?

1224
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,540
Let's say your fridge is going
to order your groceries for you.

1225
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,884
What if one day I want to
try coconut milk ice cream.

1226
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:09,800
JAMES WHITTAKER: I
remember my mother-in-law--

1227
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,290
I remember tasting
flavored coffee one time

1228
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:13,960
and thought, um, that's really good.

1229
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,930
And every time we went to visit
her she had flavored coffee flavor

1230
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:19,620
and I'm like, how do I tell her?

1231
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,290
So I mean, we don't have to worry
about hurting machine's feelings.

1232
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,250
And so you just--

1233
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,190
>> SPEAKER 7: Tell it.

1234
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,106
>> JAMES WHITTAKER: Yeah.

1235
00:56:27,106 --> 00:56:27,690
Tell it.

1236
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:28,540
Speak to it.

1237
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:30,301
Or whatever.

1238
00:56:30,301 --> 00:56:33,050
The interfaces-- I think there's
going to be a time, a phase where

1239
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,662
we are going to be discovering this.

1240
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:37,870
It seems to me that you know, you said
touch screens are really getting good.

1241
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:39,960
To me that means they're doomed.

1242
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,790
Because as soon as we perfect
technology, we don't use it anymore.

1243
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:46,550
>> PCs got really good, and
we're like, oh sorry.

1244
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,584
We're cheating on our
PCs now with these.

1245
00:56:48,584 --> 00:56:51,750
These are going to get really good and
it's going to go into something else.

1246
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,400
>> 10 years.

1247
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,830
10 years seriously.

1248
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:54,910
10 year cycles.

1249
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:55,720
Think about that.

1250
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,600
It is as reliable and as
accurate as Moore's law.

1251
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,960

1252
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,875
>> Anybody who hasn't
asked a question, yet?

1253
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:07,340

1254
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,970
>> So I also teach a course on
storytelling, and on creativity,

1255
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,800
the brain science guy
on how to be creative.

1256
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:19,440
Neuropsychology is a
really, really cool topic.

1257
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,970
And I've decoded creativity and I
know what it takes to be creative.

1258
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:25,920
>> So if you all enjoyed this,
I can come back sometime

1259
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,810
and teach one of the other seminars.

1260
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:32,820
And the storytelling class actually
tells six stories and deconstruct them.

1261
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,440
If you go to docs.com, you can see
me doing this with a high school.

1262
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,790
I give a high school commencement speech
throughout the state of Washington.

1263
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,970
>> And I give this speech,
and then deconstruct it,

1264
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,960
and talk about why you all have
been sitting here paying attention.

1265
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,020
When most of the time you sit
there and stare at a PowerPoint,

1266
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,140
you're bored of fucking tears, right?

1267
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:57,360
>> There is actually a
method to the madness.

1268
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,111
And I tell a great
story about Larry Page.

1269
00:57:59,111 --> 00:58:00,610
SPEAKER 6: Can we come to workshops?

1270
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,736
Or do you just do seminars?

1271
00:58:01,736 --> 00:58:04,151
JAMES WHITTAKER: Well, I teach
these monthly at Microsoft.

1272
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:04,820
All of them--

1273
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,320
>> SPEAKER 6: But for creative writing,

1274
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,444
JAMES WHITTAKER: Oh, right.

1275
00:58:07,444 --> 00:58:08,220
Got it, no.

1276
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,270
I give homework.

1277
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:14,130
And so, at Microsoft, the way I do
it is I take classes and chop them

1278
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:17,310
into four bits, and give homework,
and then we talk about the homework

1279
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:20,050
afterwards.

1280
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:21,830
It would be great.

1281
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,700
So maybe we could do one together.

1282
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,490
>> I just hate running workshops.

1283
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,270
So I don't do it,
because I don't like it.

1284
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,311
Not that it's not important,
it's very important.

1285
00:58:29,311 --> 00:58:31,369
I just don't like it.

1286
00:58:31,369 --> 00:58:32,160
Any more questions?

1287
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,060

1288
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,610
Peace.

1289
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:39,052
