>> DAVID J. MALAN: This is CS50.

51
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,940
And this is the end of Week 0, but
the start of a beautiful friendship.

52
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,250
We are so excited to be
here at Yale University

53
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,530
for the very first time with our
friend Scaz, and Jason, and Andy.

54
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,320
All 40 of CS50's TF's
and CA's here at Yale.

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,440
And all of you.

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,470
And in fact, it's probably time to--

57
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,914
>> [APPLAUSE]

58
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:43,722

59
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:47,920
>> So, even though most of the lectures
will indeed be in Cambridge this year,

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,250
the reality is that by design, and
very much deliberately in CS50,

61
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,740
I do think we're nearing the point
technologically, and pedagogically,

62
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,930
where it can be a superior educational
experience to engage with some

63
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,610
of the course's material online.

64
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,862
Indeed, the reality-- and if I believe
this philosophically-- is that lectures

65
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:05,070
are not a particularly
effective means for delivering

66
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,900
fairly complex information.

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,219
Certainly over hour
plus long spans of time.

68
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,760
And indeed every few minutes--
I remember myself in college--

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,210
you zone out for a moment,
you miss some complex topic,

70
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,540
and you're gone pretty much
for the next 45 minutes.

71
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,414
And the reality is that whether
you're here in New Haven or Cambridge

72
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:22,930
or beyond, the simplicity of having
the ability to pause and fast forward,

73
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:26,270
rewind, hyperlink to related
resources, search full text transcripts

74
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,900
and the like is an opportunity that
I dare say for our online students

75
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,530
well beyond New Haven,
offers them an opportunity

76
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,700
to really grasp the
conceptual material that we

77
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,700
introduce in lectures all the better.

78
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,415
>> But ultimately in CS50, is
the students' experience

79
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:43,099
is characterized so, so much more
by the course's problem sets,

80
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,140
or weekly programming projects, the
course's sections led by the teaching

81
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,600
fellows, the nightly office hours led by
the course assistants and the teaching

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,330
fellows, and indeed such
events as CS50 Puzzle

83
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,500
Day, CS50's Hack-a-thon, the CS50
Fair, weekly lunches, and so much more.

84
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,580
And so whether you're here in New
Haven, or tuning in from afar,

85
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,270
today in Cambridge, and
we'll see you again soon,

86
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,580
the reality is this is
one and the same class.

87
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,990
And we are so excited to
be here all together today.

88
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,110
And so at the end of the semester,
whether here or afar, well

89
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,910
hopefully you wear proudly, happily,
and perhaps with a bit of relief,

90
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,459
the shirt that bears witness
to you having taken CS50.

91
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,700
>> So where did we leave off on Wednesday?

92
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,410
We took a look at
computational thinking.

93
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,830
And that's toward what we distilled
computer science unto, at least

94
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,800
for now.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,990
But we distilled it little further into
at least three components elements.

96
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,570
>> Inputs, so what is the
problem we're trying to solve?

97
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,650
Outputs, what is the
answer we're hoping to get?

98
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,210
And the representation there of.

99
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,870
And we won't dwell here on
after on binary, or even ASCII,

100
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,050
and the like so much, but
rather take for granted

101
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,520
that we can represent this information,
because the far more interesting parts

102
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,010
of those problems are not just the
inputs and outputs, but the algorithms

103
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,020
that go into solving those problems.

104
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,120
>> And you might recall from
the other day that we

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,860
took a fairly traditional
concept of looking someone up

106
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,240
in a fairly large phone book, or
more generally digitally these days,

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,420
just a very large data set.

108
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,840
A really big contacts list, with
lots of names alphabetically sorted.

109
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,310
And we realized that while I
could approach this problem simply

110
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,520
by using a linear
approach-- page by page,

111
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,775
or even two's at a time-- we realized
that the more intuitive algorithm--

112
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,840
just kind of dividing and conquering
the problem again, and again,

113
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,670
and again-- halving it with each
time, gave us this green result.

114
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,080
And it's so much flatter
because it suggests

115
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,160
that even as this problem
gets bigger and bigger,

116
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,470
as is the case these days with data
sets and reality-- Facebook and Google

117
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,630
search results and the
like-- does our algorithm

118
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,660
perform just as effectively
with those bigger bites

119
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,310
as it did even with the smaller bites.

120
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,330
>> Now it begs the question, what
can we actually solve similarly

121
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,820
with this kind of intuition?

122
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,740
This sort of division and conquering?

123
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,029
Well, we could do something
like this today here.

124
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,070
We could take attendance.

125
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,102
So maybe like 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11--

126
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,560
not going to be all that efficient.

127
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,990
So wait, grade school.

128
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,770
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
16, 18 and so forth.

129
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,140
But could we do a little better?

130
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,630
>> I'm pretty sure I can't
do this by myself.

131
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,420
So if you'll humor us for just
a moment, we brought with us

132
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,640
an algorithm that's
just got three steps,

133
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,130
but it does require-- if you
don't mind-- all of us stand up,

134
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,690
if you would.

135
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:23,901

136
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:29,380
So, with all of us now standing, step
one of this algorithm is the following.

137
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,680
Stand up and assign
yourself the number 1.

138
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,180
So at this point in time,
literally everyone in this room

139
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,830
hopefully is thinking to themselves,
however awkwardly, the number 1.

140
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,020
>> Now step two of this algorithm is
going to involve the following.

141
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,680
Step two, pair off
with someone standing,

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,970
add your numbers together, and
adopt the sum as your new number.

143
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,110

144
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,620
Quick sanity check.

145
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,180
What number is everyone thinking of now?

146
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,930
>> So 2, except maybe for one,
awkward, lonesome person.

147
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,269
If we have an odd number
of people in the room.

148
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:06,560
So one person might still be
the number 1, that's fine.

149
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,440
But step three here, one
of you should sit down.

150
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,620
The other should go back to step
two, and repeat, if you would.

151
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:54,430

152
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,240
>> So if still standing, you should be
among those going back to step two.

153
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:13,910

154
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,574
Keep going.

155
00:08:14,574 --> 00:08:20,790

156
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,130
A few people still standing.

157
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:33,590

158
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,614
>> So, if still standing,
pair up with someone.

159
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:53,710

160
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,020
All right, dwindling down.

161
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:06,394

162
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:07,560
A few people still standing.

163
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll help if need be.

164
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,855
Remember the key takeaway here, is how
much faster this is than me counting.

165
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:15,090

166
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,200
>> So let's see.

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,900
I can help out.

168
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,425
So what number are
you still thinking of?

169
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,320
>> AUDIENCE: I'm at 44.

170
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,400
>> DAVID J. MALAN: 44, so
you go ahead and sit down.

171
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,733

172
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,840

00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:28,380
All right, go ahead and sit down.

175
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,390
Who else is still standing?

176
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,550
86.

177
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,340
And is anyone else still standing?

178
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,976
>> What number?

179
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:37,380
I heard 67.

180
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,370
And then in top?

181
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,900
32.

182
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,230
Anyone else still standing
and thinking of a number?

183
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,730
>> Oh, hi.

184
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,230
Sorry.

185
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,350
Be right back.

186
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,520
42.

187
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,758
Anyone else?

188
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,610
>> AUDIENCE: 47.

189
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,930
>> DAVID J. MALAN: 47.

190
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,980
Is anyone else still standing
who hasn't been counted?

191
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:06,450
So the final number of people in a room
that has 497 seats is-- all of which

192
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,930
are filled-- is 390.

193
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,230
So this is great.

194
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,435
>> We will soon discuss the notion
of a bug in a computer program.

195
00:10:16,435 --> 00:10:19,660
But we'll come back to that before long.

196
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,440
But in theory, what might
have happened just now?

197
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,930
So even though there were three big
steps to this algorithm, each of those

198
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,510
was just kind of one big operation.

199
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,020
And there was this cyclicity to it
in that if you were still standing,

200
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,870
you kept going from step three to two,
step three to two, step three to two.

201
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,330
>> But what kept happening
on each iteration?

202
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,440
Each cycle of this loop?

203
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,940
What was happening
elsewhere in the room?

204
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,170
Not only the same thing, but what
was happening to half of you?

205
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,170
Sitting down.

206
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,710
And so there in lies this insight,
much like the phone book example,

207
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,050
in that if half of you are
sitting down each time,

208
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,560
the problem is starting
with maybe 400 people,

209
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,780
then to 200 people, than 100 people,
then 50 people, and so forth.

210
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,660
>> And so we whittle down in
theory to just one person,

211
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,830
thinking of the total value of everyone.

212
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,777
Now reality, some social dynamics,
and some arithmetic errors

213
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:07,360
might contribute to that ultimate bug.

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,300
But in theory, while I
was still counting away,

215
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,860
taking several dozen
steps, or hundreds of steps

216
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,240
to count yourselves, to count
a roomful of 500 or so people

217
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,560
should have taken far fewer steps,
because you can only divide 500 and 1/2

218
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,350
so many times.

219
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,120
And so just like with the phone
book example the other day,

220
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,740
did we have something
logarithmic so to speak,

221
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,870
whereby if we were all
operating in unison,

222
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,000
and ignoring the
addition errors, would we

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,140
have achieved exactly
that kind of running time?

224
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,900
>> Now to be fair, kind of cheated, in
that I leveraged another resource.

225
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,320
Whereas it's just one of me,
I leveraged hundreds of you.

226
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,340
But that might be said to be an
example of parallel processing,

227
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,400
or a state of art very much in vogue
where computers these days have

228
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,830
multiple CPUs, or more
technically, more multiple cores,

229
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,550
and can truly do multiple
things at once, much like you

230
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,706
all we're doing there, in parallel.

231
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:56,580
But recall that what we
also did on Wednesday

232
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,640
was try to capture this intuition
and formalize it in code.

233
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,165
Something like pseudo-code.

234
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:07,040
And in fact, and I hope you'll
forgive, it's like 80 degrees in here.

235
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,420
So I'm going to take this
off for just a little bit.

236
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,410
What I thought we'd do is transition
now to an application whereby

237
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,300
we again engage the audience,
but write a program in English

238
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,537
like syntax, with which to
solve this problem here.

239

>> [END PLAYBACK]

259
00:12:42,423 --> 00:12:45,510
DAVID J. MALAN: --that video,
but it is a little addictive,

260
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,540
if not a bit annoying.

261
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,623
But to do this, I thought what we'd
do is try to write a program together,

262
00:12:49,623 --> 00:12:51,870
for which we need three volunteers.

263
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,350
Have to be comfortable
on camera and internet.

264
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,820
Sam, come on up.

265
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,830
Purple shirt, right here, come on up.

266
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,470
>> And from over here, let me
go a little farther back.

267
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,280
Crimson and blue shirts, come on up.

268
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,980
Perfect.

269
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,790
Come on now.

270
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,490
Come on up, come on up.

271
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,581
>> And what's your name?

272
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:14,080
Erica.

273
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,289
David, nice to meet you.

274
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,830
If you'd like to take this seat here.

275
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,900
This is Sam.

276
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,690
>> What's your name?

277
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,260
Antonio.

278
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,595
Antonio, nice to meet you.

279
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:23,790
Erica and Sam, if you'd
like to have a seat here.

280
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,700
What we've come prepared with,
as these guys are discovering,

281
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,580
is the ingredients with which to make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

282
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,520
>> Now this might be something that
you take very much for granted.

283
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,430
But we've given each
of our three volunteers

284
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,500
here-- two volunteers and Sam here, a
loaf of bread each, a plate, a knife,

285
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,740
a jar of jelly or jam, and
a jar of peanut butter.

286
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,190
And the goal at hand now is
going to be for these three

287
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,030
to make a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

288
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,000
But what we're going to do is expect
the audience-- since all of you

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,710
surely know how to do
this so well in reality--

290
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,380
are going to provide us with
the step by step instructions.

291
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,970
The pseudo-code, if you will.

292
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,922
>> So I'll play the role of scribe here.

293
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,880
And I've got a little to-do list,
and so as each of you, one at a time,

294
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,588
calls out a potential
instructional, I'll

295
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:06,110
write it down, repeat it as needed.

296
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,650
And then you guys are going to make
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

297
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,171
only by doing what you are told.

298
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:12,670
So think of yourselves as computers.

299
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,740
>> You can only do what you're told.

300
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,948
No assumptions, no questions.

301
00:14:14,948 --> 00:14:16,660
You just need to do it.

302
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,460
So who would like to hazard the first
instruction for making a PBJ sandwich?

303
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,460

a little more precise.

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,197

350
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,405
DAVID J. MALAN: Say it again.

351
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,946
AUDIENCE: Repeat step five again.

352
00:16:31,946 --> 00:16:37,380
DAVID J. MALAN: And
repeat step five again,

353
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,400
which is going to create
a bit of a problem

354
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,600
now if we're doing this step by step.

355
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,640
So now we go back to step five.

356
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,760
Lightly place hand on top
of peanut butter and unscrew

357
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,990
and put lid next to the peanut butter.

358
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,340
Then grasp the peanut butter
and repeat step five again.

359
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,410
>> So we'll override that
infinite loop, if you will.

360
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,400
Step seven, someone else.

361
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,918
Yeah, in back.

>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

366
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:23,175
>> DAVID J. MALAN: On the
other hand on the other top.

367
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:28,880

368
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,895
Do you want to just come up here?

369
00:17:30,895 --> 00:17:34,750
How do I finish the instruction?

370
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,790
What's the rest of the instruction?

371
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,140
>> AUDIENCE: Ignoring that part.

372
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,050
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Ignoring that part.

373
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,192

374
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:44,900
Let's start over.

375
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,400
Step seven.

376
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,516

>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

378
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:56,090
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Grasp with
opposing hand-- this is good.

379
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,544
This is actually good.

380
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,750
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

381
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,975
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And plastic jar--

382
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:06,675
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

383
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:08,420
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And twist--

384
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,488
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

385
00:18:11,488 --> 00:18:13,730
>> DAVID J. MALAN: For two seconds.

386
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,800
Just open the peanut butter jar.

387
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,020

388
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,632
I hope you'll forgive.

389
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,840
So let's assume we got there.

390
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,240
Open the peanut butter jar.

391
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,008

392
00:18:27,008 --> 00:18:32,570
>> [APPLAUSE]

393
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,790
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Step eight, let's go.

394
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,510
Step eight, yes, in back.

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,772

397
00:18:44,772 --> 00:18:45,700
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Good.

398
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,040
Step nine, yes?

399
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,924
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

400
00:18:48,924 --> 00:18:51,567
>> DAVID J. MALAN: --out of
the peanut butter jar.

401
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:53,830
And-- and what?

402
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,729
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

403
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:58,222
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And put knife
back into peanut butter.

404
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:11,130

405
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,090
Step ten.

406
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,050
Step ten.

407
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,970
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

408
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,710
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Put the knife
out, and then remove the seal.

409
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,060
Nice.

410
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,400
Off the peanut butter.

411
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:34,490

412
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,406
All right, step 11.

413
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:37,322
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

414
00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:42,520

415
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,164
>> DAVID J. MALAN: OK, grey computer
follow blue or red computer.

416
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:49,631
Good.

417
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,054
>> [APPLAUSE]

418
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:55,920

419
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,170
DAVID J. MALAN: Bring us home.

420
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,570
Couple more steps.

421
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,250
What's next?

422
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,590
Steps 12.

423
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,161
Step 12.

424
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:05,123
Yeah?

425
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:14,262
>> AUDIENCE: Put one of the slices of
bread gently on one of your hands.

426
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:17,550
>> DAVID J. MALAN: One of your hands.

427
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,760
And then, step 13.

428
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,260
Yeah?

429
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,220
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

430
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,580

431
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,150
>> DAVID J. MALAN: --on slice of bread.

432
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,950
Good.

433
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,260
Pretty good.

434
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,990
Step 14, yeah.

435
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:38,126
>> AUDIENCE: Undo step 13.

436
00:20:38,126 --> 00:20:39,950
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Undo step 13.

437
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,690

438
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,770
Let's move on to jelly.

439
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,900
It's a 100- step program,
but we're were on step 15.

440
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,210
Yeah.

441
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,170
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

442
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:53,050

443
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:59,570
>> DAVID J. MALAN: 7 through 13 using
the jelly, because those went so well.

444
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,530
Repeat steps 7 through
13, using the jelly.

445
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,940
So grasp the lower half of the
jelly jar with one hand on top.

446
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,970
On the other hand of the
other top, ignoring that part,

447
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,430
grasp with opposing hands,
the lid and the plastic jar

448
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:18,300
at the bottom, and
twist for two seconds.

449
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,940
Then open the jelly jar.

450
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,290

451
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,580
And lastly, let's try to
give us something edible.

452
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,270
Step 16.

453
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:35,820

454
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,130
So why don't we leave it there.

455
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,879
Thank you so much to
our three volunteers.

456
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:41,466
[APPLAUSE]

457
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,920

458
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,300
>> We have a little CS50
stress ball for you.

459
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,540
It was going to be a
sandwich but-- so what

460
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,130
was the point, beyond having a
bit of fun with the algorithm?

461
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,140
But the reality is that even when
you're programming a computer,

462
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,050
you need to be super precise.

463
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,030
As complex or intimidating
as your own computer

464
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:06,670
might very well be to you, at
least when something goes wrong,

465
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,150
the reality is it's a pretty dumb
device that was invented by us humans,

466
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:13,267
and can only do a subset of what we
do-- sometimes certainly faster--

467
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:15,100
but it doesn't know how
to make assumptions.

468
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,070
It doesn't know how to be on
the same wavelength as you.

469
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,280
>> It will only do precisely
what you tell it.

470
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,070
And you'll be struck,
perhaps, as we start

471
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,770
writing actual code with the
first problem sets and beyond,

472
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,490
just how easy it is to make
an assumption as a human,

473
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:31,880
and not anticipate I need to handle
that case, or that corner case,

474
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,900
so to speak, that might very well
arise if for instance Sam had the only

475
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,711
squeezable jar of jelly, whereas
everyone else had some glass jars as

476
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:39,210
well.

477
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,170
So before we turn our
attention to some actual code,

478
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,680
allow me to introduce the
course's heads here at Yale.

479
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,058
Our friends Scaz, Andy, and
Jason to come up and say hello.

480
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:52,544
>> [APPLAUSE]

481
00:22:52,544 --> 00:22:58,022

482
00:22:58,022 --> 00:23:01,060
>> SCAZ: We've lost Jason temporarily.

483
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,440
Hi again, everyone.

484
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,610
My name is Scaz.

485
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,860
I've been teaching at Yale since 2001.

486
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,820
And when I am not teaching,
my research is in robotics

487
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,620
and artificial intelligence.

488
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:17,700
>> And the announcement that I have today
is that starting in a couple of weeks,

489
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,170
we're going to be bringing some
supplementary material to CS50 to talk

490
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,510
about intelligence software.

491
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,230
We're going to talk about how
places like Netflix and Hulu

492
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,780
can recommend movies which
you might want to watch.

493
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,710
Where we'll talk about how
driver-less cars actually work.

494
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,020
And we'll be able to ground
these things in the concepts

495
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,730
that you're learning
in this class today.

496
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:45,410
>> Because all of these things are
built upon the same foundation.

497
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,396
And that's what this
series will explore.

498
00:23:47,396 --> 00:23:49,520
So I'm really looking
forward to seeing more of you

499
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,260
all, and you're going to get to
see more from all of us very soon.

500
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,500
Let me then introduce Jason.

501
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,950
>> JASON: Hi everyone.

502
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,290
My name is Jason.

503
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,540
I unfortunately went to
Harvard as an undergrad.

504
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,020
That's going to get cut
out of the actual stream.

505
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,870
>> And now I'm here as a lecturer in
the computer science department.

506
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:14,825
And I'm helping run the course
with Scaz, David and Andy.

507
00:24:14,825 --> 00:24:17,140
>> ANDY: Hey guys.

508
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,980
My name's Andy.

509
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,992
I am actually the only Yale
student on the stage right now.

510
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:25,464
>> [APPLAUSE]

511
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:29,440

512
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,770
>> I'm in Berkeley College,
originally from Solon, Ohio.

513
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,240

514
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,930
And I was one of those kids
where, when I came to Yale,

515
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:42,030
I really thought that I would never
have to look at a number ever again.

516
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,240
And then I realized that you needed
both science and QR credits to graduate.

517
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,340
And so my freshman spring, I took
a class, a CS, intro CS class here

518
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,230
at Yale.

519
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,710
I was like, this is like
actually pretty cool.

520
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:01,330
>> And while I actually ended up declaring
as a global affairs major, the skills

521
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,910
I learned in CS and programming
are so applicable to any field

522
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,970
you choose to do.

523
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,770
And the staff here at Yale,
we've been so hard at work

524
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,800

all in section and office hours.

DAVID J. MALAN: Thank you.

530
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,940
So just before class began,
we had an opportunity

531
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,660
to walk around campus
with a cellphone and take

532
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,530
some selfies in video form of really
my first tour of Yale's campus here.

533
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,420
And so we thought we'd share a rough
cut of exactly this as Scaz and Andy

534
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,970
and Jason took me around campus.

535

-Can we go on a tour?

543
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,845
-Let's go on a tour.

544
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:57,523
-Road tour.

545
00:25:57,523 --> 00:25:59,106
-This sign has been there for a while.

00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:00,200
-Whah, CS50.

Hi Frank.

559
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:26,855
-How are you?

-Good to see you.

561
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:29,390
-Welcome to the video.

562
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,270
Don't act too excited.

563
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,502
>> -I love Silliman.

Ahh!

565
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,780
>> -It's been about three hours since
Jason had ice cream and Nutella.

566
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,189
So we've got to stop back at
Silliman for a little bit.

00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,220
>> -Yeah.

>> -tell much about Yale so far.

And that's considered off campus.

575
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,659
>> -Here we have gothic architecture.

576
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:04,200
World famous.

577

We have some more gothic architecture.

578
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:10,614
And construction, and
more gothic architecture.

579
00:27:10,614 --> 00:27:11,114
Hi.

580
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:15,470
This is where we're having office hours
Tuesdays through Thursdays in Hogwarts,

581
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,922
as [INAUDIBLE] .

582
00:27:16,922 --> 00:27:20,620

583
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,120
-All right.

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,078
That's it for the tour.

585
00:27:22,078 --> 00:27:24,030
We are at Yale University's
Law School, where

586
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,870
today's lecture is about to take place.

587
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,220
Let's head in.

588
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,375
>> [END PLAYBACK]

589
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,370
>> DAVID J. MALAN: And
that brings us here now.

590
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:38,040

591
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,770
So thus far, we've been
focusing on pseudocode,

592
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,430
which is this English-like syntax.

593
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,030
It has no prescribed specification.

594
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,030
It's just you use some
intuitive language if you

595
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,950
want to explain what you want to do.

596
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,270
>> But let's begin now to transition
to code, as most people would say.

597
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,880
But more precisely, something
known as source code.

598
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,210
This is the language that humans
write that computers ultimately--

599
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,780
possibly after some number of
steps-- ultimately understands

600
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,530
so as to know how to do something.

601
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,120
That you saw a glimpse of
this perhaps on Wednesday.

602
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,780
>> This is an example that
incredibly, underwhelming

603
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,220
when run simply says "hello world."

604
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,510
And it's written in a language called
C, which is syntactically very similar

605
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,676
to a lot of other languages
that you might not know,

606
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:18,409
but might have heard of like Java,
and C++, and Python, and Ruby,

607
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:21,200
and the like, and indeed, we'll
spend much of the semester using C,

608
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,530
and then toward the end of the
semester, building upon it,

609
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,446
and introducing any
number of other languages.

610
00:28:25,446 --> 00:28:28,810
Among them PHP, and JavaScript,
a database language called SQL.

611
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:31,526
But with C, what we'll have
this bottom-up understanding

612
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:33,900
of exactly how computers work,
what you can do with them,

613
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,252
and how you can solve problems
all the more effectively by this

614
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,460
layering that we discussed
on Wednesday, and standing

615
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,870
on the shoulders of others.

616
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,200
But more on that to come.

617
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,650
>> Today we look at a simpler environment,
but a fundamentally identical

618
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,970
environment known as Scratch by
our friends at MIT Media Lab.

619
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,570
This is a graphical
programming language, Scratch,

620
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,330
whereby you can drag
and drop things that

621
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,430
look like puzzle pieces that
only interlock if it makes

622
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,872
logical or programmatic sense to do so.

623
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:02,330
But it's going to allow us to
have a conversation about all

624
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,604
of the same programming
fundamentals that some of you

625
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:06,520
might know already, that
many of you might not

626
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,670
know anything of without having
to get bogged down frankly,

627
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,150
in the intellectually
uninteresting syntax of semicolons,

628
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,950
and parentheses, and
quotes, and the like.

629
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,910
All of which, early
on, are a distraction

630
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,322
to what are interesting
and genuinely useful ideas.

631
00:29:20,322 --> 00:29:22,280
So let's take a quick
glance at the environment

632
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,180
here, so that you know what awaits.

633
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,060
And in fact, among the games we
can play are a few programs written

634
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,810
by CS50's own former students.

635
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,200
One of them, myself, I'll be this one
written in graduate school for me.

636
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,030
>> If I could take one volunteer
who's willing to play

637
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,420
a game for the very first time.

638
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:40,920
Sure.

639
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,690
Come on up.

640
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,565
What's your name?

641
00:29:42,565 --> 00:29:43,372
>> AUDIENCE: Angela.

642
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:44,830
DAVID J. MALAN: Angela, come on up.

643
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,220
So Scratch has been out for a few years.

644
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,960
And when I was in graduate school,
I was cross registered at MIT,

645
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,392
taking professor Mitchel Resnick's
course on educational technologies.

646
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:56,350
And we were among the very first
students in the world to actually beta

647
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,120
test Scratch.

648
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,090
And my project was what Angela
has now graciously volunteered

649
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,060
to play called Oscartime.

650
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,507
>> So I'm going to go ahead and
double click the icon here.

651
00:30:04,507 --> 00:30:07,590
It's going to open up a programming
environment that we'll soon dive into.

652
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,720
I'm going to full-screen
it for Angela, here.

653
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,490
I'm going to hit the green
flag in just a moment.

654
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:15,130
And then a whole lot of trash
is going to fall from the sky.

655
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,830
And you're going to use the mouse
here to actually drag and drop

656
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,169
the trash into Oscar's trash cans.

657
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:23,210
So if you want to go ahead and click
the green flag, the game will begin.

If you really want to see
something trashy, look at this.

664
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,570
I have here a sneaker
that's tattered and worn.

665
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,750
It's all full of holes holds
and the laces are torn.

the day I was born.

667
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,434
I love it because it's--

668
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:02,600
DAVID J. MALAN: --green these days just
be throwing everything in the trash.

669
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,312
And so what one of
CS50's own staff did--

670
00:31:04,312 --> 00:31:06,270
Jordan, who you might
meet today-- has actually

671
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,030
updated this for today's times.

672
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,800
And so allow me to open up
a remix instead for Angela.

673
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,600
And we'll play this instead for
a few moments where now you're

674
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,600
going to have to decide between whether
to throw something in the trash,

675
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,050
or recycle it or compost it.

676
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,280
So there's a bit of
pressure on you to get

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,040
this right in front of your 392 to
497 classmates here in the hall,

But thank you to our volunteer, Angela.

699
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,920
We have a stress ball
for you here as well.

700
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,790
So thank you.

701
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,250
>> So this one was written by me.

702
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,324
But now one by an actual former student
who implemented this, which is a game.

703
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:46,490
All in this language called
Scratch, that we'll soon

704
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,850
peel back the layers of.

705
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,940
But if we'd like-- how
about another volunteer?

706
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,440
Right.

707
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,970
>> Come on up.

708
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,070
What's your name?

709
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,570
Glance?

710
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,280
Lance.

711
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,082
Lance, come on up.

712
00:32:54,082 --> 00:32:54,790
Nice to meet you.

713
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,170
Come on this way.

714
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:59,940
So this one might have a
theme familiar to some of you.

715
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,180
But you'll see too that
there can be interactivity,

716
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,242
whereby you could actually be the
role of the character moving around.

717
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:05,950
Nice to meet you.

718
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,470
David.

719
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,464
>> I give you, Pikachu.

720
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:12,380
Instructions will about
to come on the screen.

721
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,070
But in short, you're going to
want to catch the tasty stuff,

722
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,827
and avoid the bombs and other things.

723
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:19,910
With the cursors entirely.

724
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,320
So hit the space bar.

725
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,820
-Pikachu.

726
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,480
DAVID J. MALAN: Catch
the stuff on the left,

727
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,938
don't catch the stuff on the right.

728
00:33:24,938 --> 00:33:27,576

729
00:33:27,576 --> 00:34:44,540
>> [MUSIC PLAYING]

730
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,332
>> So one last one here.

731
00:34:46,332 --> 00:34:48,040
If we could have one
more volunteer here.

732
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,760
We thought we'd recreate something
from-- in the yellow shirt--

733
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,110
from Wednesday.

734
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,540
What is your name?

735
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,090
Mary, come on up Mary.

736
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:01,340
>> And recall on Wednesday we introduced
the notion of binary, and binary bulbs.

737
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,930
This is actually now an
implementation of that same interface

738
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:07,360
that we had on the iPad with the light
bulbs, but here digitally rendered.

739
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,220
And rather than do a stress
ball-- nice to meet you, David.

740
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,600
We brought a few light
bulbs from Cambridge.

741
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,650
>> If you can, clicking on those
bulbs to turn them on and off,

742
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:29,510
come up with the binary
representation of say 256.

743
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,500
And you'll see in the
middle, the current tally.

744
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,690
So that one's on.

745
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,810
So the leftmost bit is on.

746
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,016
>> MARY: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

747
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:39,292

748
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,280
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Well,
so we have just-- oh.

749
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,780
So this is the 128 column.

750
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,460
So we're up to 128.

751
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,769
We got to get to 256.

752
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,560
And you can tinker on
and off, no big deal.

753
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,700
Or you can hit that 128
more times if you want.

754
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,310
>> All right, good.

755
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,090
24.

756
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,790
Yeah, getting closer.

757
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,105
Closer!

758
00:36:02,105 --> 00:36:05,980
Oh, what's the problem then?

759
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,510
So what's the issue?

760
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,040
>> So what do we need to
solve this problem?

761
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,060
So we need another bit.

762
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,770
And this is perfectly
reasonable in reality, right?

763
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,800
If you want to count from the number
1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

764
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,880
to actually roll over to 10, you're
going to need an additional bit.

765
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,240
So let's actually
rewind here, and come up

766
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,790
with-- that was obviously
meant to be a set up.

767
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,590
>> You can't do 256 with just a bulb.

768
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,290
So how about simply the number 50?

769
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:29,977
Number 50.

770
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:34,550

771
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,100
Excellent.

772
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,050
A big round of applause
for Mary and hers as well.

773
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,840
Thank you.

774
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,570
>> So this topic-- intentional as
that was-- will actually recur.

775
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,020
The largest value that you can
represent with eight bits, or one byte,

776
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,750
is indeed 256.

777
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,770
But not if you start
counting from 0, as we

778
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,060
seem to keep doing by having
all of those bits off.

779
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,530
But now let's dive into the underlying
implementation of this environment,

780
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,200
and tease apart some of these ideas.

781
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,350
>> So in a moment we're about to see a
few different programming fundamentals.

782
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,080
The first of which we'll call statement.

783
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,360
Sort of verbs, if you will.

784
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,960
Actions.

785
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,180
Things that should be done.

786
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,430
>> And in a moment you'll see
blocks that look like this.

787
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,940
Say "hello world," for instance.

788
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,330
Or wait one second.

789
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,834
Or play sound meow.

790
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:20,500
And indeed the environment in
which we're going to be doing this

791
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,610
is called Scratch.

792
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:25,060
>> And if I pull up Scratch without
preloading any actual code,

793
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,830
let's take a quick look at this
user interface, so to speak.

794
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,730
The controls with which we interact.

795
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,840
On the top left here of the
screen, below the menus,

796
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,650
we have the stage, so to speak.

797
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,550
So Scratch is what we'll call Sprite.

798
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,520
It's a character.

799
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,660
>> And he can be controlled by
writing programs against him.

800
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,950
And he'll be able to move up and down
and left and right in this environment,

801
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,075
not just by moving the
mouse, but programmatically.

802
00:37:46,075 --> 00:37:48,930
I can tell him walk right, walk
left, up, down or the like.

803
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,440
And I can introduce other
sprites or characters as well.

804
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,616
>> Indeed, on the bottom here is where
you'll see your list of sprites.

805
00:37:54,616 --> 00:37:56,865
At the moment, I just have
one, but I can create more,

806
00:37:56,865 --> 00:37:58,880
and they'll appear exactly down there.

807
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,630
So if you rewind for a moment, like
Oscartime-- for instance, Oscar,

808
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,590
on the left, the trash
can, was a sprite.

809
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,450
And the thing in the middle, the
recycling bin, was another sprite.

810
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,300
And the compost bin was another sprite.

811
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,790
And every piece of
garbage or recyclables

812
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,590
that was falling from the sky
is also a sprite, each of which

813
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,150
was programmed individually.

814
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,040
>> How do you program?

815
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,180
Well, over here on the right
hand side is the scripts area.

816
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,930
And this is where we can
drag and drop puzzle pieces.

817
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:26,066
In a week, it's going to be
where we equivalently write code

818
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:28,940
with more of a keyboard, but for
today it'll be dragging and dropping

819
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,680
puzzle pieces, the
palettes for which can all

820
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,190
be found here right in the middle.

821
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:35,190
Indeed, in the middle
here there's a whole bunch

822
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,910
of categories of puzzle
pieces or blocks.

823
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,500
One's related to motion, look,
sound, a pen going up and down,

824
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,860
data, events control.

825
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,654
Not quite sure yet
what all of these mean,

826
00:38:45,654 --> 00:38:47,820
but you'll see that they've
been nicely categorized.

827
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,680
And to write a program in
Scratch, let's do exactly that.

828
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,480
>> I'm going to start off under
Events, and drag this one here.

829
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,470
When green flag clicked.

830
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,704
Now why that one?

831
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:59,120
Well recall that our volunteers
came up, the first thing I

832
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,017
or they did was click that green
flag in the top right hand corner.

833
00:39:02,017 --> 00:39:03,600
And that just means start the program.

834
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,560
>> So when that event happens,
what do I want to do?

835
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,070
I'm going to go under Looks,
and I'm going to do "say hello."

836
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,000
And I'm going to change this and
say something like "hello Yale."

837
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,970
And now I'm going to zoom
out, click the green flag,

838
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,050
and voila, I've written a program.

839
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,990
It's not all that exciting
just yet, but this

840
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,195
is exactly where each
of those author started,

841
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,740
both with Pikachu, and the
binary bulbs, and Oscartime,

842
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,890
and so many more examples.

843
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,150
>> You start super simple, and
then you start to layer,

844
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,046
and add on features and functionality.

845
00:39:31,046 --> 00:39:32,920
So what are these layers
going to consist of?

846
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,086
Well, beyond statements, we'll also
have things that are little more fancily

847
00:39:36,086 --> 00:39:38,910
called Boolean Expressions,
after someone named Bool.

848
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,820
And a Boolean expression is simply an
expression that's either true or false,

849
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,740
yes or no, 1 or 0.

850
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,480
>> Any polar opposites like that.

851
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,902
It's either true or not.

852
00:39:48,902 --> 00:39:51,360
But we're also going to see
ones that might look like this.

853
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,925
So for instance, is the mouse down?

854
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:54,550
They're sort of questions, if you will.

855
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,650
>> The mouse is either down,
true or it's not, false.

856
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,990
1 or 0, if you will,
tends to be the mapping.

857
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,740
True is 1, false is 0.

858
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,740
Well what about less than this?

859
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,400
Or so, is this less than this?

860
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,650
That's a question of sorts.

861
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,140
>> And if you put two
numbers in there, either x

862
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,010
is going to be less than y or
equal to y, or greater than y,

863
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,635
but this block we'll see, is just
going to answer the question,

864
00:40:14,635 --> 00:40:15,810
is this less than that?

865
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,650
We might also see something like this.

866
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,790
Touching mouse pointers.

867
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:21,610
So in Scratch, you can ask
the question, is the Sprite

868
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,800
touching the mouse pointer?

869
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,040
Other words, is the cursor hovering
over the cap, or the equivalent?

870
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,100
>> We'll see anding things together.

871
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,970
You can ask two questions, and
make sure that both of them

872
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,920
give you yes or true answers before
making a decision to do something.

873
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,709
But then how do you make decisions?

874
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:38,000
Well, we have these conditions.

875
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,041
>> And we saw this in our
example of the phone book.

876
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,900
Looking to the left or
right for Mike Smith.

877
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,140
And in the condition, you
do something potentially,

878
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,240
if a Boolean expression is true.

879
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,720
>> And indeed, notice the shapes now.

880
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,250
There's this placeholder right now
on the overhead where we can fit--

881
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,532
if I rewind one slide-- that shape.

882
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:55,740
It's not quite the same size.

883
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,400
And indeed, you'll see that
Scratch resizes things dynamically

884
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,479
to fit puzzle pieces, but the
shape is what's important.

885
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:03,270
This thing looks like
that, and indeed it's

886
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,410
roughly the same shape
that should fit in there.

887
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,520
And if we want to do something
this way or that way, if or else,

888
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,080
we have this puzzle
piece in Scratch as well.

889
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,450
>> Now suppose you wanted to
do if, else if, or else.

890
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,120
In other words, a
three-way fork in the road.

891
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,656
Well what can you do
just by glancing at this?

892
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:25,030
I can take this puzzle piece,
and it doesn't seem to fit,

893
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,670
but again, Scratch is going
to re-size nicely for us.

894
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,940
I could start to layer
these things together.

895
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,900
>> So now I have a three-way
fork if this is true, do this.

896
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,560
Else if this other thing is true,
go this way, else go this other way.

897
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,200
And in The Muppet Movie, the
fork in the road, so to speak,

898
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,610
between Yale or Stanford, was
exactly that, just two conditions.

899
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,190
Either go this way, else go that way.

900
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,940
>> Well, loops also exist in programming.

901
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,100
And we've used these already in
class and in pseudocode code,

902
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,060
and surely in those
Scratch programs forever.

903
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,730
Scratch has this puzzle piece that
will just let you do something forever.

904
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,688
And sometimes you want
to do something forever.

905
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:58,810
It's not necessarily a bug, it's
because you want a clock to keep going,

906
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,730
or a game to keep playing.

907
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:04,800
Or you can specify a finite number of
steps, as with this repeat block here,

908
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,550
which will repeat something 10 times.

909
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,560
We can set variables, we'll soon see.

910
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,300
And with variables, similar in spirit
to algebra, like x, or y, or z.

911
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,390
It's something symbolic that can store
some value, some piece of information,

912
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,320
that you might want
to remember for later.

913
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,080
>> Best example of this might be
a game where you have a score,

914
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,080
like in Pikachu.

915
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,180
How many pieces of cake
and whatnot did you catch?

916
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,340
Well, that might be a variable
called score that starts at 0.

917
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,400
And then every time we caught a
piece of cake or candy, or the like,

918
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,720
it gets incremented.

919
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,990
It gets added to one at a time.

920
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,450
And so a variable stores a
piece of information like that.

921
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,450
Then there's arrays, and we'll come
back to these in a week or two time,

922
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,900
but an array is kind of like an
inventory or a satchel, inside

923
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,940
of which you can put virtual things.

924
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,852
It allows you to store more
than one piece of information.

925
00:42:49,852 --> 00:42:51,810
And that might be useful
if in the game, you're

926
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,630
sort of walking around
picking things up.

927
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,879
And maybe you want to keep
all of those pieces of cake

928
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:58,260
around, and not just eat
them one after another.

929
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,010
And then there's a
fancier construct we'll

930
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,932
come to called functions or procedures.

931
00:43:02,932 --> 00:43:04,640
And though we're going
faster here, we'll

932
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,345
see that these are a very
natural solution to problems

933
00:43:07,345 --> 00:43:08,470
that we're going encounter.

934
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,220
As our programs start
getting bigger we'll

935
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,640
start to notice patterns in
the code that we're writing,

936
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,556
the puzzle pieces we're
dragging and dropping.

937
00:43:14,556 --> 00:43:18,240
And as soon as you notice yourself doing
something again and again, or worse yet

938
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,400
copying and pasting programming
code that you've written,

939
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,612
that's probably an
opportunity to factor out

940
00:43:23,612 --> 00:43:25,820
whatever you keep copying
and pasting, and putting it

941
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,430
in something called a "function."

942
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,690
But more on those in much
more detail before long.

943
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,314
>> And then there's even fancier features.

944
00:43:31,314 --> 00:43:34,100
For those of you more comfortable,
or taking APCS or equivalent,

945
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,600
Scratch actually supports things
like threads and events and more.

946
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,840
So realize that it has
a fairly high ceiling,

947
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,540
even though it's also very
broadly accessible to folks

948
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,460
who have never programmed before.

949
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,130
So indeed, let's take a look
at a simple program or two.

950
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:49,920
>> We already looked at how we
might say hello with Scratch.

951
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,800
Let me go ahead and open up a
little more interesting program

952
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,100
that I wrote in advance.

953
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,430
And this one's called Pet the Cat.

954
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:58,954
All of these programs will be
available on CS50's website.

955
00:43:58,954 --> 00:43:59,870
Indeed, already there.

956
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,190
>> So you can download
them, and play with them,

957
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,850
and with Problem Set 0, which
is also on the course's website,

958
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,516
you're encouraged to walk through these.

959
00:44:05,516 --> 00:44:07,820
And moreover, we have a
number of walk-through videos

960
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,951
online in which I and
CS50's team truly walk

961
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:14,200
through each of these examples at a much
slower pace, a very fast forwardable,

962
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,530
or rewindable pace, so that you can walk
through these at your leisure as well.

963
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,330
So here's Scratch on the left.

964
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,920
Here's a program at the right
that I've already pre-made.

965
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,880
So let me zoom in on this.

966
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,780
And could someone in English, knowing
what you know, just from now as

967
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,650
to how Scratch works, sort of say
in an English phrase or sentence,

968
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,450
what does this program apparently do?

969
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,836
>> Yeah, in orange shirt.

970
00:44:36,836 --> 00:44:40,804
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

971
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:41,796

972
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:44,980
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Yeah, if your
cursor is on Scratch the cat,

973
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,220
play a meowing sound.

974
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,870
But notice how we express that.

975
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:49,980
There's apparently a
loop there, forever.

976
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,000
And then there's a
condition, the if expression.

977
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,090
And collectively, what do those mean?

978
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,210
It means this program
is just always running,

979
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,510
and it's just always waiting
and watching and listening

980
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,730
for me to move my mouse over the cat.

981
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,810
>> Because each time I do that, as
you propose, it's going to do this.

982
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,475
Let me start the program.

983
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:08,350
Nothing seems to be
happening, but notice how

984
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:10,152
it's highlighted now in a yellow line.

985
00:45:10,152 --> 00:45:11,360
That just means it's running.

986
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,770
And because there's a forever
loop, it's still running.

987
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:19,610
>> So let me move my cursor over Scratch.
[MEOW] [MEOW] And if I move it off,

988
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:25,444
[MEOW] now it stops, but the program's
still running. [MEOW] And so, adorable.

989
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:28,550
[MEOW] So let's open up
slightly more advanced

990
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,620
example called Don't Pet the Cat.

991
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,805
>> And now let's see what
happens here. [MEOW] Meowing.

992
00:45:35,805 --> 00:45:39,297
So it's a little on
auto pilot, if you will.

993
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:39,880
--pet the cat.

994
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,820
I wonder why.

995
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,389
[ROAR] [MEOW] So how did this work?

996
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:47,930
Well, you can kind of reason
through it intuitively, perhaps.

997
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,346
>> But let's look at the actual code.

998
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,819
So again, when the green flag
is clicked, do this forever.

999
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:53,110
What do you want to do forever?

1000
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,150
Well, if touching mouse
pointer, then play

1001
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,270
a sound that's apparently called Lion
5, that's inside of this project, else

1002
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,010
play sound meow, and
then wait two seconds, so

1003
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,510
that it's not meowing incessantly.

1004
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,650
In fact, you can very quickly start
to annoy yourself and your roommates.

1005
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:08,690
>> Let's remove this block.

1006
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,580
And notice what's nice about Scratch.

1007
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,070
Things just kind of drag
and drop and interlock.

1008
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,980
So again, it grows to
fill what you want.

1009
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:20,118
But if I remove this, and then
hit play, [COMPUTER BLIP SOUND]

1010
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:22,904
>> --it's kind of tripping over
itself, because it's literally

1011
00:46:22,904 --> 00:46:23,820
doing what I'm saying.

1012
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:27,080
It's saying forever play this sound, but
I'm not giving it a chance to finish.

1013
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,205
And so that would be a bug.

1014
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:30,700
And that's why we had
this thing in here now.

1015
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,030
So let's actually start from scratch--
sort of pun slightly intended--

1016
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,450
in which we now have the cat move.

1017
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:38,130
>> So I'm going to do this on the fly.

1018
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,910
I'm going to zoom in here, just
to get me started on Events.

1019
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:42,000
And green flag clicked.

1020
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,410
And there's other ways
to start the scripts.

1021
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,920
We're going to keep it simple here.

1022
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,049
>> And now I'm going to go
ahead and go under Control.

1023
00:46:48,049 --> 00:46:50,590
And again, if you forget where
things are, just click around,

1024
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:52,048
and eventually you find them again.

1025
00:46:52,048 --> 00:46:53,680
So I want to forever do what?

1026
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,650
I want to use the motion block
that I know exists, move 10 steps.

1027
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,016
>> So let's see what happens
here if I play this game.

1028
00:47:02,016 --> 00:47:03,390
Thankfully it doesn't go too far.

1029
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,190
I can still kind of grab him
by the tail and pull him back.

1030
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,860
But the program's still running,
so he's kind of fighting me.

1031
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,870
But it'd be kind of nice if I
conditionally fix this in code.

1032
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,800
>> Because this is not--
actually this is really

1033
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,770
not a fun game for anyone of any age.

1034
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:18,915
So let's try to fix this by
having some kind of conditions.

1035
00:47:18,915 --> 00:47:21,670
So I'm going to go under
Control, and then if.

1036
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,660
I like this idea.

1037
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,470
So after moving 10 steps,
if-- let me sense where I am.

1038
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,799
I'm going to go under Sensing,
and then it looks I can go here.

1039
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:31,840
row to the shape matches.

1040
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,380
>> Size doesn't, but it's
going to grow to fill.

1041
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,984
And now this is a little menu.

1042
00:47:35,984 --> 00:47:38,650
And now mouse pointer-- I don't
want the mouse, I want the edge.

1043
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:41,700
So Scratch is smart enough to know
when a sprite is touching the edge.

1044
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,360
What do I want him to actually do?

1045
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,025
>> Let me go ahead and change motion.

1046
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:46,940
You know what?

1047
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,242
I'm going to have him turn around.

1048
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,200
So at 15 degrees isn't
really going to help me.

1049
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,990
I want him to turn around
and go the other way.

1050
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,740
>> So let's see what happens
here, if I hit Play now.

1051
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:01,520
OK, kind of stupid looking, but
it's doing exactly what I said.

1052
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,540
And it's rotating the whole sprite.

1053
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,900
Now it turns out I can fix this.

1054
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,691
And I didn't know how
to fix this at first.

1055
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:09,190
I kind had to futz around and
see the best way to do this.

1056
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,630
But if I go to-- let's see, motion.

1057
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:14,050
Oh, I found this.

1058
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,660
Actually, Set Rotation Style.

1059
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,431
Left, right, or don't
rotate, or all around.

1060
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,930
And it turns out that's what I want.

1061
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,920
And I'm going to put this is not my
loop, because I don't need to set

1062
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,487
the rotation style multiple times.

1063
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:27,570
I'm going put it at the very top of
this program so that it gets set once,

1064
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:28,670
and then remembers.

1065
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,340
And now I'm going to try this again.

1066
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,520
Let me stop the program.

1067
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,050
>> And now that fixed that bug.

1068
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,700
So I'm iteratively improving upon this.

1069
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,900
The program is getting a
little more complex and bigger,

1070
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,810
but I'm taking baby steps so to speak,
and small bites out of the problem

1071
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,010
to get it better and better.

1072
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,260
But this too, is kind of lame.

1073
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:43,900
>> You know what?

1074
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,860
Would ask someone with a really good,
frightful voice like to come up?

1075
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,210
Someone with a voice.

1076
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:54,070

1077
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:54,570
Uh, yeah.

1078
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:55,550
Come on up.

1079
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:57,990
In the green shirt.

1080
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,530
>> So it turns out there's some other fun
things, aesthetics and sounds alike.

1081
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,290
Here's the meow.

1082
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:04,000
I click on the Sounds tab.

1083
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,730
[MEOW] There's the meow. [MEOW] [MEOW]
[MEOW] --actually record something

1084
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:10,310
of our own here.

1085
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:13,120
>> So let's do exactly that.

1086
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:17,670
Instead of using this cat sound, let's
go ahead here, and what's your name?

1087
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:18,850
Nick, nice to meet you.

1088
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,350
It's David.

1089
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:21,474
So in a moment, I'm going
to hit the Record button.

1090
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,240
And if you can just
yell into the laptop,

1091
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,140
"ouch," as though you
just walked into the wall,

1092
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,180
that will be much appreciated.

1093
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,660
1, 2.

1094
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,470
>> NICK: Ouch!

1095
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,470
DAVID J. MALAN: Awesome.

1096
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,410
And now can do a little editing here.

1097
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:35,910
Going to get rid of the quiet parts.

1098
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,000
And I think that's good.

1099
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,690
Thank you very much.

1100
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,315
>> NICK: Pleasure.

1101
00:49:38,315 --> 00:49:43,277

1102
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:45,110
DAVID J. MALAN: I've
just renamed it "ouch,"

1103
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,901
but now I'm going to
go back to my scripts.

1104
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,810
And notice there is indeed sound here.

1105
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,520
And I'm going to go ahead
and play the sound ouch,

1106
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,991
and I'm going to do that if
it's touching the edges only.

1107
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,740
And then I'm going to
have it turn around.

1108
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,250
So let's see what happens here.

1109
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,728
Let's go full screen.

1110
00:50:01,728 --> 00:50:02,394
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

1111
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:03,790
-Ouch!

1112
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,290
Ouch!

1113
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,790
Ouch!

1114
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:07,790
Ouch!

1115
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,160
Ouch!

1116
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,780
Ouch!

1117
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,587
Ouch!

1118
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:12,086
Ouch!

1119
00:50:12,086 --> 00:50:12,492
>> [END PLAYBACK]

1120
00:50:12,492 --> 00:50:14,490
>> DAVID J. MALAN: So you realize
that we're getting a little lucky.

1121
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:17,110
I'm going to have him move
like 100 steps at a time.

1122
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:21,790
The effect of which now is going
to be-- [COMPUTER GLITCH SOUND] So

1123
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,490
within reason.

1124
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,470
So an opportunity to refine that
further if we really want to.

1125
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,340
>> So now let's introduce another concept.

1126
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,660
To let me go into one called
Counting Sheep and use something

1127
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,610
called a variable.

1128
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:34,700
This is an adorable little sheep, and
I changed his costume so to speak.

1129
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,450
So even though the default is a
cat, you can upload, you can draw,

1130
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,020
you can do any number of
characters on your sprite.

1131
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,740
Here's a program that's
going to do what in English?

1132
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,110
>> Based again on just what you know now.

1133
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,230
What's this program do?

1134
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,740

1135
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,500
Yeah, it's going to count.

1136
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,842
One number at a time.

1137
00:50:55,842 --> 00:50:57,550
We have apparently
have this set counter.

1138
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,380
>> I don't know what that is,
but maybe it's a variable.

1139
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,740
It's just a container, x or y.

1140
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:04,290
But the word counter is more
descriptive than mathematician's x or y.

1141
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:06,560
So we can use English words for things.

1142
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,490
Forever, just means keep doing this.

1143
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:10,020
>> Say counter.

1144
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,270
Now where did this come from?

1145
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,240
Well, it turns out that
counter is a variable.

1146
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,645
So it's just another puzzle
piece I created in advance.

1147
00:51:15,645 --> 00:51:18,020
And even though it happens
not to be the same shape here,

1148
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,540
normally you would say
something like hello here.

1149
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:23,610
>> You can also drag a variable
so that that's what's get said.

1150
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:26,170
Then I wait for a second, I
change the counter by one,

1151
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,940
incrementing it by adding one.

1152
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:32,407
So that the net effect is
this adorable counting sheep.

1153
00:51:32,407 --> 00:51:33,615
Though he's counting himself.

1154
00:51:33,615 --> 00:51:36,642

1155
00:51:36,642 --> 00:51:38,350
Now it's very quickly
going to get boring

1156
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,900
because he's going to
do this truly forever,

1157
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,240
but that's exactly what the
program's design prescribes.

1158
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,090
Lets now try another example
that leverages a variable.

1159
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:51,140
This one called Hi Hi Hi, that
does get annoying quickly.

1160
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,987
Now this one has two scripts.

1161
00:51:52,987 --> 00:51:54,570
And so again, we're taking baby steps.

1162
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,236
>> We started with something super
small, added to it, added to it.

1163
00:51:57,236 --> 00:51:59,750
Now I want to do something
even more dynamic,

1164
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,950
so I want to be listening for
two different things at a time.

1165
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,420
So on the left, when
green flag is clicked,

1166
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,100
I set a variable that I wrote
in advance called Muted.

1167
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,700
And I arbitrarily set it to 0.

1168
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,290
So Scratch doesn't have true and
false, but it does have 0 and 1.

1169
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:15,270
>> So I can approximate that same idea.

1170
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:21,110
And then forever, if the space bar is
pressed, then set the variable to 0.

1171
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:21,810
Or sorry.

1172
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:25,920
If the Space is pressed, and
if muted, the variable, is 0,

1173
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,950
then set muted to 1,
else set muted to 0.

1174
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:32,370
This seems sort of like we're
just doing and undoing work.

1175
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,130
>> But what's the effect?

1176
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,588
Every time I hit the space bar,
what happens to my variable

1177
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:38,150
called muted, logically?

1178
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,100
Sort of gets flipped.

1179
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,035
It changes from 0 to 1, or 1 to 0.

1180
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:43,035
So it took a few blocks
to express that, but all

1181
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:47,280
I'm doing is toggling the state of
this variable to 0 or 1, or 0 or 1

1182
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,530
each time I hit the space bar.

1183
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,905
Now over here, what's this doing?

1184
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:53,400
Forever, if muted is 0,
so if muted is false.

1185
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,910
So if it's not muted, is the
semantics there, play sound sea lion,

1186
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:00,810
and think Hi Hi Hi for two
seconds, wait two seconds.

1187
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,710
So notice now these
scripts are effectively

1188
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,100
going to run in parallel so that one can
be listening for one action, the other

1189
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,010
to make a decision based on that action.

1190
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,655
And it can do this forever.

1191
00:53:10,655 --> 00:53:12,638
>> [SEA LION BARKING]

1192
00:53:12,638 --> 00:53:14,852
>> [SEA LION BARKING]

1193
00:53:14,852 --> 00:53:20,050
>> It's going to do this forever and
[SEA LION BARKING] as I've just done.

1194
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,010
And now it's still running
but I've "muted" the game.

1195
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:27,260
[SEA LION BARKING] And that's
all this guy does now too.

1196
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,660
>> Let's open another example here.

1197
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,840
Let me go into Events,
and now this adorable too.

1198
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,130
But notice it has two sprites.

1199
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:37,520
So not just two scripts with
one sprite, but two sprites.

1200
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,750
And if I click on the blue guy as I
already have, I see he as one program

1201
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:43,790
up here that literally just says
this, when I receive an event,

1202
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:45,620
say "Polo" for two seconds.

1203
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,460
>> So if you've ever played in
a pool, the game Marco Polo,

1204
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,500
if the orange guy script is
any indication, apparently

1205
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:57,380
every time I hit the space bar,
what's the orange guy going to do?

1206
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,642
He's going to say "Marco."

1207
00:53:58,642 --> 00:53:59,850
And then this is a new block.

1208
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,409
We've not seen this before,
but broadcast an event.

1209
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,200
And I could call it
event anything we want.

1210
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,033
>> We'll come back to this
perhaps before long.

1211
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,410
But broadcasting an event
is a way for one sprite

1212
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:11,836
to talk to another by
essentially passing it a message.

1213
00:54:11,836 --> 00:54:12,960
It's not a message you see.

1214
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,130
It's not something visual.

1215
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:17,370
It's sort of a computer message
that the other guy is listening for.

1216
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:21,210
Because indeed, the blue guy, recall
doesn't have when green flag clicked.

1217
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,290
>> He instead has, when I receive an event.

1218
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:26,850
When he gets handed this note in class,
so to speak, he should say "Polo."

1219
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,200
And so the net effect is that when I
hit the green flag, nothing happens.

1220
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,940
But when I hit the space bar, he says
"Marco," he responds with "Polo."

1221
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,350
But the only sprite I'm
interacting with is the orange one.

1222
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,980
So this is a way of kind of
passing messages between sprites

1223
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,210
and having them communicate
with one another.

1224
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:46,280
>> Now let's look at one last
one here called Threads.

1225
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,370
And notice this by playing it.

1226
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,184
So these are two sprites.

1227
00:54:51,184 --> 00:54:52,600
The bird is kind of flying around.

1228
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,310
He's bouncing.

1229
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,890
There's no "ouch," but same idea.

1230
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,230
>> But the cat seems pretty smart.

1231
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,010
What is the cat apparently doing?

1232
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:03,430
And wait for it.

1233
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,010
What is the cat apparently doing?

1234
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,740
It's not just bouncing.

1235
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,860
>> He's following the bird.

1236
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:13,920
And so apparently, there's a way
with a combination of blocks here--

1237
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,760
and let's look at the cat real fast.

1238
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,270
Forever, if touching bird, then play
the sound Lion 4, whatever that is.

1239
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:21,360
We heard it once.

1240
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,431
Otherwise, point towards
bird, and move one step.

1241
00:55:25,431 --> 00:55:27,680
Now the fact that it's one
step is what gives the bird

1242
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,850
a bit of an advantage
initially, but if we instead

1243
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,980
make this 10, for instance, so
that every iteration of loop he's

1244
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,100
moving 10 steps of time.

1245
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,280
So more space.

1246
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,650
Let's see what happens then.

1247
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,740
[LION ROAR] Not all that much better.

1248
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,460
So now let's try to improve
upon these a little iteratively,

1249
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,330
and come back to that
notion of a function.

1250
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:46,580
>> And indeed one of the fundamental
takeaways of the class design.

1251
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,560
Not just writing programs that work
and that are correct, but are well

1252
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,080
designed.

1253
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,349
And design is much more subjective,
and you'll get better at it over time.

1254
00:55:54,349 --> 00:55:57,390
But let's take some baby steps toward
starting with a program that works,

1255
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,310
absolutely, but it's not very good.

1256
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,650
It's not very well written.

1257
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,830
>> So here's a program that does this.

1258
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:08,060
Cough, cough, cough.

1259
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,880
What does the program look like?

1260
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,330
Looks correct to me.

1261
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,370
It's saying couch for a
second, then it waits.

1262
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,515
>> Then it says it again, then it waits.

1263
00:56:14,515 --> 00:56:16,056
Then it says it again, then it waits.

1264
00:56:16,056 --> 00:56:18,770
And then the program implicitly
ends, because there's no loop.

1265
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:21,325
But why is this a badly written program?

1266
00:56:21,325 --> 00:56:22,950
Even if you've never programmed before?

1267
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,240
Like, what rubs the
wrong way, perhaps here?

1268
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,016
Yeah?

1269
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:29,278
>> AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1270
00:56:29,278 --> 00:56:29,950

1271
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,950
DAVID J. MALAN: Exactly.

1272
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:32,700
You're repeating
yourself again and again.

1273
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,190
And literally, I copied and pasted
two of those blocks again and again.

1274
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,237
And that's exactly the sort of sanity
check that you should be making.

1275
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:39,820
Wait a minute.

1276
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,070
Should I really be doing this?

1277
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:43,610
So what's this what's the
obvious solution perhaps?

1278
00:56:43,610 --> 00:56:44,680
Have some kind of loop.

1279
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,860
And I don't quite recall
what the puzzle piece is,

1280
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:48,810
but if I look at the
next iteration here,

1281
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:50,560
indeed, there's not
just the forever loop,

1282
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
there's repeat some number of times.

1283
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,080
And so I've specified three.

1284
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,839
And now notice how much tighter, how
much more succinct this program is.

1285
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,630
And in a sense, how
much more maintainable.

1286
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,840
If I want to change the word
from cough to something else,

1287
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,530
like achoo, like he's sneezing.

1288
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:09,770
Then I change it in one
place, and not three.

1289
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:12,050
So this already feels like
slightly better design.

1290
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,610
Let me instead open cough
2, our third example.

1291
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:17,670
>> Notice as a computer scientist,
I start counting at 0, typically.

1292
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:20,950
Now this looks a little scarier at
first, but the effect is the same.

1293
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,590
Cough, cough, cough.

1294
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:26,920
But what seems to be fundamentally
new in the top part of the program?

1295
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,670
I've removed the say.

1296
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,830
>> I've removed the wait.

1297
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,370
And what have I plugged in instead?

1298
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:32,890
A function.

1299
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:33,670
A cough block.

1300
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,410
I mean, frankly, I seem kind
of an idiot if I didn't just

1301
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,285
start with the block
that's apparently called

1302
00:57:37,285 --> 00:57:38,894
"cough," if that's all I want him do.

1303
00:57:38,894 --> 00:57:40,310
But that doesn't exist in Scratch.

1304
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,396
Rather I went to one in the
palette called More Blocks here,

1305
00:57:43,396 --> 00:57:46,270
and I drag this big purple thing
here that lets me define a function.

1306
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,240
It essentially lets me
create my own puzzle

1307
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,280
piece that can be called anything I
want, that can do anything I want,

1308
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,360
but it gives it a name.

1309
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:57,050
It gives me a new, purple puzzle piece
that now does whatever I tell it to do.

1310
00:57:57,050 --> 00:58:01,060
So this purple piece here
corresponds to this one here.

1311
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,960
>> And what does it do?

1312
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,930
It says cough for a
second, and then it waits.

1313
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:07,330
And now I've sort of created
my own custom puzzle piece,

1314
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:10,040
so that it behaves
exactly that same way.

1315
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,130
So I can keep doing this.

1316
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:14,421
And indeed, there's going to be more and
more opportunities for modularization,

1317
00:58:14,421 --> 00:58:16,630
and for layering, complexity
on top of one another.

1318
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:18,547
But this basic idea,
indeed in problem said 0.

1319
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:20,338
What you're going to
be challenged to do is

1320
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:23,810
to download Scratch, or just use it
on the web, and just have fun with it.

1321
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:26,056
We'll give you a set of
requirements, having a sound,

1322
00:58:26,056 --> 00:58:27,430
and some number of puzzle pieces.

1323
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,480
But you'll do exactly this.

1324
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,771
And you'll realize that you're going to
want to take some baby steps initially,

1325
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:33,690
until your program gets
more and more complex.

1326
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,010
But considering is this the
best way I could do this?

1327
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:39,210
Can I avoid this instinct
perhaps, to copy and paste?

1328
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:41,850
>> But before Problem Set
0, and before we adjourn,

1329
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,980
thought we'd take up one
more volunteer if we could,

1330
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,820
for a final program
that's perhaps the most

1331
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,150
fitting at all, given today's venue.

1332
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,298
Come on down.

1333
00:58:50,298 --> 00:58:51,234
Yeah.

1334
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:52,170
Yes.

1335
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,431
What's your name?

1336
00:58:53,431 --> 00:58:53,930
Uh-oh.

1337
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,820

1338
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,010
That's OK.

1339
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,230
Both come down.

1340
00:59:01,230 --> 00:59:05,520
And I've will deal with this somehow
within that next ten seconds.

1341
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,550
So come on down.

1342
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:08,370
Come on down.

1343
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:13,250
>> Let me come on up here.

1344
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:16,050
Come on.

1345
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:16,685
All right.

1346
00:59:16,685 --> 00:59:21,360

1347
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,360
Let's see here.

1348
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,735
So notice real fast here,
if you'd like to come on up.

1349
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:28,650

1350
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:29,926
>> We'll do two rounds of this.

1351
00:59:29,926 --> 00:59:30,800
And what's your name?

1352
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,270
>> SABRINA: Sabrina.

1353
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,060
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Sabrina and?

1354
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,622
>> YING GEE: Ying Gee.

1355
00:59:32,622 --> 00:59:33,360
>> DAVID J. MALAN: Ying Gee.

1356
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,276
Nice to meet you both.

1357
00:59:34,276 --> 00:59:34,970
David.

1358
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:38,785
So our final example here is
called Ivy's Hardest Game.

1359
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:41,160
And why don't we have you do
Level 1, and you do Level 2.

1360
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,350
>> And we'll see how far
