00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:05,590

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,940
>> DOUG LLOYD: OK so a suggestion
before starting here.

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,660
If you haven't watched the video on
pointers you might want to do so first.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,860
Because this video is another
way of working with pointers.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,574
>> So it's going to talk
about some concepts

8
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:19,490
that we cover in the
pointers video, and we're

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,948
going to gloss over them now,
assuming that they're already

10
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,090
sort of understood.

11
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,440
So that's just your fair warning
that if you're seeing this video

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,814
and you haven't seen the
pointers video, it might sort of

13
00:00:27,814 --> 00:00:29,610
fly over your head a little bit.

14
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,080
And so it might be better
to watch it in that order.

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,710
>> So we have already seen one
way to work with pointers,

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,810
which is we declare a
variable, and then we

17
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,160
declare another variable, a pointer
variable, that points to it.

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,870
So we've created a
variable with a name, we've

19
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,480
created a second variable with a name,
and we point that second variable

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,220
at that first.

21
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,370
This sort of has a
problem though, because it

22
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,650
requires us to know exactly
how much memory we're

23
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,600
going to need the moment
our program is compiled.

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,220
>> Why is that?

25
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:03,338
Because we need to be able to name or
identify all of the possible variables

26
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:04,129
we might encounter.

27
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:07,910
We might have an array that might be
able to hold a lot of information,

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,110
but it's still not
exactly precise enough.

29
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,640
What if we don't know,
what if we have no idea

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,370
how much we'll need at compile time?

31
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,020
Or what if our program will
run for a really long time,

32
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,810
accepting various user
data, and we can't really

33
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,170
estimate whether we're
going to need 1,000 units?

34
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,060
>> It's not like we can
say at the command line

35
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,040
enter how many items
you think you'll need.

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,100
Well what if that guess is wrong?

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Dynamic memory allocation
sort of allows us the way

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,867
to get around this particular problem.

39
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,700
And the way it does it
is by using pointers.

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,140
>> We can use pointers to
get access to dynamically

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,710
allocated memory, memory that is
allocated as your program is running.

42
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,290
It's not allocated at compile time.

43
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,570
When you dynamically allocate
memory it comes from a pool

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,795
of memory known as the heap.

45
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:56,420
Previously all the memory we've
been working with in the course

46
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,920
has been coming from a pool
of memory known as the stack.

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,470
A good way to generally
keep in mind-- and this rule

48
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,720
doesn't always hold true,
but pretty much almost

49
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,940
always holds true-- is that any
time you give a variable name it

50
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,090
probably lives on the stack.

51
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,650
And any time you don't
give a variable a name,

52
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,160
which you can do with dynamic memory
allocation, it lives on the heap.

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,190
>> Now I'm kind of presenting this as
if there's these two pools of memory.

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,740
But you may have seen this
diagram, which is generally

55
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,290
a representation of
what memory looks like,

56
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,373
and we're not going to care about all
the stuff at the top and the bottom.

57
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:33,580
What we care about is this part in
the middle here, heap and stack.

58
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,570
As you can see by
looking at this diagram,

59
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,390
these actually aren't two
separate pools of memory.

60
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,757
It's one shared pool of memory
where you start, in this visual

61
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:44,590
you start at the bottom
and start filling up

62
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,040
from the bottom with the stack, and you
start at the top and start filling up

63
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,072
from the top down with the heap.

64
00:02:50,072 --> 00:02:51,780
But it really is the
same pool, it's just

65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,050
different spots, different locations
in memory that are being allocated.

66
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,060
And you can run out of
memory by either having

67
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,240
the heap go all the way
to the bottom, or have

68
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,440
the stack go all the way to the top,
or having the heap and the stack

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,740
meet up against each other.

70
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,500
All of those can be conditions
that cause your program

71
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,030
to run out of memory.

72
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,952
So keep that in mind.

73
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,660
When we talk about
the heap and the stack

74
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,880
we are really talking about the
same general chunk of memory, just

75
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,930
different portions of that memory.

76
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,910
>> So how do we get dynamically
allocated memory in the first place?

77
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,740
How does our program get
memory as it's running?

78
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,660
Well C provides a function called
malloc, memory allocator, which

79
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,810
you make a call to, and you pass in
how many bytes of memory that you want.

80
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,940
So if your program is running
and you want an integer runtime,

81
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:46,040
you might mallock four bytes of
memory, malloc parentheses four.

82
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,540
>> mallock will go through
looking through the heap,

83
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,750
because we're dynamically
allocating memory,

84
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,500
and it will return to you
a pointer to that memory.

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,180
It doesn't give you that memory--
it doesn't give it a name,

86
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,950
it gives you a pointer to it.

87
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,780
And so that's why again I said
that it's important to maybe

88
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,770
have watched the pointers video
before we get too far into this.

89
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,940
So malloc's going to
give you back a pointer.

90
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,950
>> If mallock can't give you any
memory because you've run out,

91
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,645
it'll give you back a null pointer.

92
00:04:10,645 --> 00:04:15,282
Do you remember what happens if we
try and dereference a null pointer?

93
00:04:15,282 --> 00:04:17,019
We suffer a seg fault, right?

94
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,060
That's probably not good.

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,579
>> So every time you make a call
to malloc you always, always

96
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:25,270
need to check whether or not the
pointer it gave you back is null.

97
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,800
If it is, you need to end your program
because if you try and dereference

98
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,360
the null pointer you're going
to suffer a segmentation fault

99
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,380
and your program is
going to crash anyway.

100
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,190
So how do we statically
obtain an integer?

101
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,730
>> int x.

102
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,010
We've probably done that
a bunch of times, right?

103
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,480
This creates a variable called
x that lives on the stack.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,190
How do we dynamically obtain an integer?

105
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,010
Int star px equals malloc 4.

106
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,050
>> Or more appropriately
we'd say int star px

107
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,680
equals malloc size of int,
just to throw some fewer

108
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,740
magic numbers around our program.

109
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,140
This is going to obtain for us
four bytes of memory from the heap,

110
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,720
and the pointer we get
back to it is called px.

111
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,430
And then just as we've
done previously we

112
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,966
can dereference px to
access that memory.

113
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,590
How do we get an integer from the user?

114
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,970
We can say int x equals get int.

115
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,930
That's pretty straightforward.

116
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,030
What if we want to create an array
of x floats that live on the stack?

117
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,210
float stack_array-- that's the name
of our array-- square brackets x.

118
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,419
That will create for us an array
of x floats that live on the stack.

119
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,960
We can create an array of floats
that lives on the heap, too.

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,330
The syntax might look a
little more cumbersome,

121
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,740
but we can say float
star heap_array equals

122
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,360
malloc x times the size of the float.

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,160
I need enough room to hold
x floating point values.

124
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,560
So say I need 100
floats, or 1,000 floats.

125
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,810
So in that case it would be
400 bytes for 100 floats,

126
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,080
or 4,000 bytes for 1,000 floats,
because each float takes up

127
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,230
four bytes of space.

128
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,110
>> After doing this I can use the
square bracket syntax on heap_array.

129
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,970
Just as I would on stack_array, I
can access its elements individually

130
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,590
using heap_array zero, heap_array one.

131
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,800
But recall the reason we can do that
is because the name of an array in C

132
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,990
is really a pointer to
that array's first element.

133
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,480
So the fact that we're declaring an
array of floats on the stack here

134
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,810
is actually a bit misleading.

135
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,600
We really are in the
second line of code there

136
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,360
also creating a pointer to a chunk of
memory that we then do some work with.

137
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,620
>> Here's the big problem with
dynamically allocated memory though,

138
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,360
and this is why it's really
important to develop some good habits

139
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,800
when you're working with it.

140
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,060
Unlike statically declared
memory, your memory

141
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,790
is not automatically returned to the
system when your function is done.

142
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,280
So if we have main, and
main calls a function

143
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,860
f, when f finishes whatever it's doing
and returns control of the program

144
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,810
back to main, all of the memory
that f used is given back.

145
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,250
It can be used again
by some other program,

146
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,250
or some other function that
gets called later on in main.

147
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,970
It can use that same memory over again.

148
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,620
>> If you dynamically
allocate memory though

149
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,380
you have to explicitly tell the
system that you're done with it.

150
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,370
It'll hold onto it for you, which could
lead to a problem of you running out

151
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,290
of memory.

152
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,179
And in fact we sometimes refer
to this as a memory leak.

153
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:24,970
And sometimes these memory leaks
can actually be really devastating

154
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,020
for system performance.

155
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,120
>> If you are a frequent internet user
you might use certain web browsers,

156
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,630
and I won't name names here, but
there are some web browsers out there

157
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,150
that are notorious for actually having
memory leaks that don't get fixed.

158
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,570
And if you leave your browser open
for a very long period of time, days

159
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,060
and days, or weeks, you sometimes
might notice that your system

160
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,790
is running really, really slowly.

161
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,640
And the reason for that is that
the browser has allocated memory,

162
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,320
but then not told the system
that it's done with it.

163
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,000
And so that leaves less memory
available for all of your other programs

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,480
to have to share, because you're
leaking-- that web browser

165
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,755
program is leaking memory.

166
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:08,880
How do we give memory back
when we're done with it?

167
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,838
Well fortunately it's a
very easy way to do it.

168
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:11,710
We just free it.

169
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,020
There's a function called free,
it accepts a pointer to memory,

170
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,010
and we're good to go.

171
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,310
>> So let's say we're in the
middle of our program,

172
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,970
we want to malloc 50 characters.

173
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:25,710
We want to malloc an array that can
capable of holding 50 characters.

174
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,109
And when we get a pointer back to
that, that pointer's name is word.

175
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,900
We do whatever we're
going to do with word,

176
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,440
and then when we're
done we just free it.

177
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,460
And now we have returned those 50
bytes of memory back to the system.

178
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,147
Some other function can use them.

179
00:08:40,147 --> 00:08:43,480
We don't have to worry about suffering a
memory leak because we have freed word.

180
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,639
We've given the memory back,
so we're done working with it.

181
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,430
So there are three
golden rules that should

182
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,700
be kept in mind whenever you're
dynamically allocating memory

183
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,990
with malloc.

184
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,480
Every block of memory that
you malloc must be freed

185
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,430
before your program finishes running.

186
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,029
Now again, in the appliance or in the
IDE this sort of happens for you anyway

187
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,820
when you-- this will happen anyway
when your program is terminated,

188
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,880
all the memory will be released.

189
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,750
But it's generally good coding
practice to always, when you're done,

190
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,810
free what you have mallocd.

191
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,690
>> That said, only things that
you've mallocd should be freed.

192
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,880
If you statically declare an
integer, int x semi-colon,

193
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,500
that lives on the stack, you
don't then want to free x.

194
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,970
So only things that you've
mallocd should be freed.

195
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,960
>> And lastly, don't free something twice.

196
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,170
That can lead to
another weird situation.

197
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,530
So everything that you've
mallocd has to be freed.

198
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,000
Only things that you've
malloc should be freed.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,730
And don't free something twice.

200
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,660
>> So let's go through an example here
of what some dynamically allocated

201
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,122
memory might look like mixed
in with some static memory.

202
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,080
What might happen here?

203
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,913
See if you can follow
along and guess what's

204
00:09:48,913 --> 00:09:51,720
going to happen as we go
through all these lines of code.

205
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,980
>> So we say int m.

206
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,840
What happens here?

207
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,339
Well this is pretty straightforward.

208
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,650
I create an integer variable called m.

209
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,400
I color it green,
because that's the color

210
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,730
that I use when I'm talking
about integer variables.

211
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,160
It's a box.

212
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,400
It's called m, and you can
store integers inside of it.

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
>> What if I then say int star a?

214
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,530
Well that's pretty similar.

215
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,780
I'm creating a box called a.

216
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,100
It's capable of holding int
stars, pointers to integers.

217
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,570
So I'm coloring it green-ish as well.

218
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,140
>> I know it has something
to do with an integer,

219
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,852
but it's not itself an integer.

220
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,310
But it's pretty much the same idea.

221
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,101
I've created a box.

222
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:30,070
Both of these right
now live on the stack.

223
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,520
I've given them both names.

224
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,750
>> int star b equals malloc size of int.

225
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,560
This one might be a little tricky.

226
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,110
Take a second and think about what you
would expect to happen on this diagram.

227
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:50,210
int star b equals malloc size of int.

228
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,940
>> Well this doesn't just create one box.

229
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,800
This actually creates two boxes.

230
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,670
And it ties, it also establishes
a point in a relationship.

231
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,240
We've allocated one block
of memory on the heap.

232
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,940
Notice that the top right box
there does not have a name.

233
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,760
>> We mallocd it.

234
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,050
It exists on the heap.

235
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,090
But b has a name.

236
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,950
It's a pointer variable called b.

237
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,910
That lives on the stack.

238
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,250
>> So it's a piece of memory
that points to another one.

239
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,840
b contains the address
of that block of memory.

240
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,757
It doesn't have a name otherwise.

241
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:24,590
But it points to it.

242
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:29,760
So when we say int star b equals
malloc size of int, that right there,

243
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,490
that arrow that popped up on the
right side there, that whole thing,

244
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,740
I'll have it appear
again, is what happens.

245
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,341
All of that happens in
that single line of code.

246
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:41,340
Now we'll get little more
straightforward again.

247
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,330
a equals ampersand m.

248
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,280
Do you recall what a
equals ampersand m is?

249
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,920
Well that's a gets m's address.

250
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,150
Or put more diagrammatically,
a points to m.

251
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,360
>> a equals b.

252
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,560
OK so here's another one.

253
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,230
A equals b.

254
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,260
What's going to happen
to the diagram this time?

255
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,330
>> Well recall that the
assignment operator works

256
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,960
by assigning the value on the
right to the value on the left.

257
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,820
So instead of a pointing to m, a now
points to the same place that b points.

258
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,900
a doesn't point to b, a
points where b points.

259
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:25,280
>> If a pointed to b that would
have been a equals ampersand b.

260
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,150
But instead a equals b just
means that and b are now

261
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,770
pointing to the same address, because
inside of b is just an address.

262
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,004
And now inside of a is the same address.

263
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,170
m equals 10, probably the
most straightforward thing

264
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,690
we've done in a little bit.

265
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,460
Put the 10 in the box.

266
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,640
Star b equals m plus 2, recall from
our pointers video what star b means.

267
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,230
We're going to dereference b and put
some value in that memory location.

268
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,860
In this case 12.

269
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,300
>> So when we dereference a point of
recall we just travel down the arrow.

270
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,205
Or put another way, we
go to that memory address

271
00:12:58,205 --> 00:12:59,580
and we manipulate it in some way.

272
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,830
We put some value in there.

273
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,960
In this case star b
equals m plus 2 is just

274
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,230
go to the variable pointed to by b,
go to the memory pointed to by b,

275
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,750
and put m plus 2 in there, 12.

276
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,970
>> Now I free b.

277
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,490
What happens when I free b?

278
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,800
Remember what I said free means.

279
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,920
What am I saying when I free b?

280
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,410
>> I'm done working with it, right?

281
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,702
I essentially give up the memory.

282
00:13:25,702 --> 00:13:26,910
I give it back to the system.

283
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:33,010
I don't need this anymore is
what I'm telling them, OK?

284
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,390
>> Now if I say star a
equals 11 you can probably

285
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,460
already tell that something bad
is going to happen here, right?

286
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,160
And indeed if I tried that I probably
would suffer a segmentation fault.

287
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,140
Because now, although
previously that chunk of memory

288
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,220
was something that I had
access to, at this point

289
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,590
now I'm accessing memory that
is not legal for me to access.

290
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,330
>> And as we will probably
recall, when we access memory

291
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,000
that we're not supposed to touch,
that's the most common cause

292
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,860
of a segmentation
fault. And so my program

293
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,170
would crash if I tried to do this.

294
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,910
So again it's a good idea to get good
practice and good habits ingrained

295
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,920
when working with malloc and free,
so that you don't suffer segmentation

296
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,310
faults, and that you use
your dynamically allocated

297
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,370
memory responsibly.

298
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,300
>> I'm Doug Lloyd this is CS50.

299
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,947
