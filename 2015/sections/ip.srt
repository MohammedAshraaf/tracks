00:00:05,152 --> 00:00:07,360
DOUG LLOYD: If you watched
our internet primer video,

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,020
I left a bit of a cliffhanger
by talking about the internet

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,857
and how it's a system of protocols.

5
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:14,190
Well, let's talk about the
first of those protocols that

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,710
actually comprises the internet.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,490
And interestingly enough, it's
called the Internet Protocol,

8
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,960
which we usually refer to as IP.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,810
>> So the internet, as I said, is an
interconnected network, an internet,

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,990
which is really just several networks
woven together and agreeing somehow

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,490
to communicate with one another.

12
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,220
What is this somehow I'm talking about?

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,720
Well, this is the Internet Protocol.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,190
This dictates how information is
transmitted from point A to point B.

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,410
And this is sort of a condition of
joining the network of the internet

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,830
is agreeing to follow this
protocol when information needs

17
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,330
to be moved from point A to point B.

18
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,700
>> So at the very end of that
internet primer video,

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,320
I showed this image of
what the internet was.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,649
And on a small scale, this is
actually probably pretty accurate.

21
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,190
This might be how three networks
actually talk to each other.

22
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,570
But it's a bit misleading.

23
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,845
And the reason it's a bit
misleading is because-- if I

24
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:07,220
just number the networks for
the sake of convenience here

25
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,350
and we get rid of everything else
and just focus on the networks--

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,750
it's a bit misleading because it
implies that all three network have

27
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,280
a connection to one another.

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,365
>> One is connected to two.

29
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:17,610
Two is connected to three.

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,990
And three is connected to one.

31
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,823
And when I talk about
a connection here, I'm

32
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:23,920
talking about a physical,
wired connection.

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,170
We do have wireless.

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,390
But it's really impractical for
data to be transmitted wirelessly

35
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,440
over a large scale.

36
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,200
And so at some point, we really do rely
on wired technology-- telephone wires,

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,980
fiber optic wires, various technologies
that are physically connecting

38
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,560
point A to point B.

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,110
>> And on a small scale like
this-- this might be accurate,

40
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,480
but as the image gets a
little bigger, let's now

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,410
imagine we have six different networks.

42
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,740
If that's true, now we have
something like this for every network

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,100
to be connected to every other network.

44
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,540
And if you look, every network
has five arrows connected to it.

45
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,450
So everything is connected
to every other network.

46
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,840
>> We only have six networks here,
and already look at how much wiring

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,630
we have to employ, right?

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,650
And the internet consists of
a lot more than six networks.

49
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,410
We can't afford to wire each
network to each other network,

50
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,940
especially considering some of
these networks span oceans, right?

51
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,810
If we're trying to connect to
a network in Asia or in Europe,

52
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,502
we're going to have to
span an entire ocean.

53
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:29,460
We're going to need to
use wires at some point,

54
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,900
but we want to minimize the
number of wires we actually use.

55
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,690
We don't want to send a
million wires across the ocean,

56
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,700
because they cost millions of
dollars apiece to lie down.

57
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,430
And so rapidly, we wouldn't be able
to afford the internet anymore.

58
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,080
So we have to have another
way for every network

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,730
to talk to every other
network or else we

60
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,784
have pieces of the internet
that are disconnected

61
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:53,200
from other pieces of the internet.

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,150
And that's not what we want.

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,890
But we don't want to have
them all wired together.

64
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,760
>> And this is where routers
come back into play.

65
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,870
We can use routers in the following way.

66
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,150
What if instead of every
network being physically

67
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,700
connected to every other network, we
had these intermediary pieces, where

68
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,460
the networks were connected
to these intermediaries, which

69
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,840
are connected to a few networks.

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,290
So instead of having one connect to
two, three, four, five, six, maybe one

71
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,360
connects to a router,
which maybe connects

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,840
to one or two of those
networks, but also

73
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,850
maybe connects to other
routers, which also

74
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,510
will connect to those other networks.

75
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,160
>> And the router's job is--
it contains information

76
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,620
called a routing table
that dictates where do

77
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,250
I go if I see a particular IP address?

78
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,080
If I see an IP address starting
with four, I'm going to go this way.

79
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,250
If I seen IP address starting with
a 12, I'm going to go that way.

80
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,230
We don't need to be connected
physically to network number four

81
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,010
or network number 12 in this example.

82
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,941
We just know generally
where we want to go.

83
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,190
And if you think about it, this is sort
of similar to the concept of recursion

84
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,445
that we talked about when
we were talking about it

85
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:04,060
in C. I'm not going to connect you
to exactly where you want to go.

86
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,130
I'm just going to move you one step
closer to where you want to go.

87
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,739
And I'll let somebody else deal with
solving the rest of the problem.

88
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:14,780
I'll just solve this little piece of
the problem and defer the rest of it

89
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,940
to somebody else.

90
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,240
So routing information is actually
kind of similar to recursion.

91
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,010
If that's a concept that you understand
well, maybe that analogy would help.

92
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,950
>> So let's take a look at
this networking example

93
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,130
again and assume that, again,
we're going to use those same six

94
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,470
networks, one through six.

95
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,220
So let's just say that every
IP address on network one

96
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,200
starts with one dot something.

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,800
And we'll say that there's
some other thing that

98
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,110
deals with how all the systems
are connected to network one.

99
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,000
We just care about connecting all of
those networks together in an internet.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,350
So every device that is
connected to network one

101
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,460
has an IP address that starts with
one dot and then three other numbers.

102
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,300
>> This is a generalization of
the way things actually work.

103
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,260
It's quite a bit more precise than this.

104
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,760
But this should give you a
general idea of what the Internet

105
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,637
Protocol is actually doing.

106
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,220
So this was the diagram we had before.

107
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,410
This was the system that
was not sustainable.

108
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,760
Even six, this might be OK.

109
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,990
But if we get to 10 or 20 or 50, we're
going to be lying a lot of wires.

110
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,139
And 50 is still also not
even the tip of the iceberg

111
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:16,680
as to the number of networks we have.

112
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,510
So this model is unsustainable.

113
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,660
We can't stick with this.

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,200
>> So let's instead adopt
this model where we get rid

115
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,030
of all the wires between the
networks and we add routers.

116
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,210
So these yellow boxes represent routers.

117
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,550
And their job is to move
information generally

118
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,040
closer to where it's supposed to go.

119
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,330
And maybe these are the connections
that these networks have.

120
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,670
And maybe these are the tables
that are built into the routers.

121
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,870
>> So if we just start by looking
at network one, for example,

122
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,450
basically what it says is if
I ever see an address that

123
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,300
doesn't start with a one-- that's what
the exclamation point one or the bang

124
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,550
one there, not one-- I'm going
to pass it off to a router.

125
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,680
And from there, the router
can make a decision.

126
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,570
The router says if I see a one, I'm
going to move to network number one.

127
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,610
That's the green arrow heading to
the left out of that top left box.

128
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,660
>> If I see a two-- that's
the arrow sort of heading

129
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,950
to the top right towards
the purple network--

130
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,920
if I see an IP address
starting with a two,

131
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm going to go towards the two network.

132
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:21,250
If I see a three, a four, a five, or a
six-- that's that red arrow coming out

133
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,800
of the top left router-- I'm not
connected to three, four, five, or six.

134
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,897
But I know somebody who is or
who's a little bit closer to there.

135
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:31,230
So I'm just going to say,
every time I see an IP address

136
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,810
starting with three, four,
five, or six, I'm just

137
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,250
going to send it to that router.

138
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,090
So I'll move it a little closer to
where it's supposed to go and let

139
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,830
that router deal with the problem.

140
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,980
>> And as you can see-- if you
wanted to pause here and trace--

141
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,600
you can get to every other point in
the network from wherever you are.

142
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,190
All six networks can still
connect to every other network

143
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,250
but they're not physically
connected anymore.

144
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,046
They're now these intermediate steps.

145
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,170
Now, of course there's a
trade off of speed, right?

146
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,240
If one was directly
connected to six, we wouldn't

147
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,390
have to go through two
routers along the way.

148
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,377
So we may be able to get the
connection a little bit faster.

149
00:07:03,377 --> 00:07:05,210
But maybe that trade-off
is worth it, right?

150
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,850
If it's going to be so expensive
in terms of actual cost, dollars

151
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,150
and cents, to physically wire
all these networks together,

152
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,150
maybe a little bit of a
slowdown in speed is OK.

153
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,530
We can tolerate that.

154
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,490
>> So again, in that example we were just
talking about, none of the networks

155
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,086
directly connect to each other all.

156
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:25,960
There could have been--
maybe in that example

157
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,659
we could have made it so that
maybe network one and two were

158
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:29,450
directly connected.

159
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,410
And that would be OK.

160
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,040
Some networks are physically
connected to other networks.

161
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,940
But they're not all
connected to each other.

162
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,360
They rely on the routers--
in this particular example--

163
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,899
to distribute the communication
from point A to point B.

164
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,190
On a small scale-- like what
we're talking about here--

165
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,850
this configuration actually might
be more inefficient than just

166
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,420
having direct connections.

167
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:52,547
But on a large scale, we can
scale the system a lot better.

168
00:07:52,547 --> 00:07:55,130
It's really going to reduce our
cost of network infrastructure

169
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,450
to have intermediary routers whose job
it is to move traffic from the sender

170
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,500
to the receiver, from point A to point
B, as opposed to wiring everybody

171
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,320
together.

172
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,380
>> So let's take a look at
an example of information

173
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,220
traveling using this Internet Protocol.

174
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,250
Let's say that I am physically
located at IP 1.208.12.37

175
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,450
so I exist somewhere on the one network.

176
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,260
And I want to send a message to you.

177
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,085
And you're on the five
network at 5.188.109.14.

178
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,210
Your IP address specifically doesn't
matter, but in this particular example

179
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,740
we're talking about this generalization
of what the internet protocol is all

180
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,429
about.

181
00:08:30,429 --> 00:08:32,720
You're on the five network,
and I'm on the one network.

182
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,309
As you can see, we're not
connected to each other at all.

183
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,335
>> So I start out.

184
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:38,710
And I want to send you a message.

185
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,650
And so somehow I communicate
that message to the router.

186
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,039
The router is the one that
actually has the IP address.

187
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,955
And it's looking at where
it's supposed to go.

188
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,655
We're going to five dot something.

189
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:49,780
So now I'm going to start
using my-- or the router,

190
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,370
rather, is going to start using its
router table to pass information along.

191
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:59,149
It sees that five is not one, so it
says I'm going to pass it to this guy.

192
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,690
Then this guy has to make a decision.

193
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,520
Where am I going to go?

194
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,705
Well, it's not a one, so I'm not
going to move to the one network.

195
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:04,770
And it's not a two.

196
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,478
I'm not going to move
to the two network.

197
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:07,410
It starts with a five.

198
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,500
I'm not connected to
five, this router says.

199
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,950
And so I'm just going to pass it off
to-- I'm going to go down this path.

200
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,462
This is where threes and
fours and fives and sixes go.

201
00:09:15,462 --> 00:09:16,920
And I'll let that guy deal with it.

202
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,710
I'll get it a little closer
to where it's supposed to go.

203
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,350
I know it's supposed to go
in that general direction.

204
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,110
But maybe that guy can deal with it.

205
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,840
OK.

206
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,650
So that guy looks.

207
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,580
He says, OK, this IP
address starts with a five.

208
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,590
Well, I'm connected to three and to
six, so I can't get the message directly

209
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,780
where it needs to go.

210
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,970
But that other router over there, I
know if I send it fours and fives,

211
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,430
it can handle those.

212
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,269
>> So it passes it along down the path.

213
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,310
And then this router says, well, I'm
connected to networks four and five.

214
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,727
So, yes, I can help you.

215
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,810
I'll take your IP address
that starts with a five.

216
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,450
I'll give it to the five network.

217
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,220
The five network will do some work on
its end and give the message to you.

218
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,580
And now we've successfully
transmitted a message from me

219
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,930
to you using the Internet Protocol.

220
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,020
>> Again, very generalized for purposes
of illustration as to what's happening.

221
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,840
But that's pretty much how
the Internet Protocol works.

222
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,050
The routers know
generally where to send it

223
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,170
and will send it one step along the
way, getting it closer and closer

224
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,130
to its destination until one
router is physically connected

225
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,990
to the network or the
address or whatever

226
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,600
in question and gives it there.

227
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,780
>> Now, in general, except for really,
really small, small messages,

228
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,830
it's not going to send it
as one big chunk of data.

229
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,870
If I'm sending you an
email-- a very long email,

230
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,270
say-- it's not going to
take that entire email,

231
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,660
bundle it up in a ball
or a package or whatever,

232
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,460
and send that entire
thing down the network.

233
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,580
>> First of all, sending information
along the network is expensive.

234
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,560
It does add up.

235
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,760
And the larger the
chunk, the more costly

236
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,240
it is to move every step of the way.

237
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,260
And if there's somehow
a slowdown and then

238
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,010
there's this giant-- sort of like
if you're driving on the highway

239
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,246
and there's this giant truck
kind of blocking the way

240
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:03,370
and you can't get around it on either
lane because it's kind of spread out.

241
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,227
It slows everybody else down behind it.

242
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,060
But small cars, if they
were all small cars,

243
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,290
they might be able to move around,
if that analogy sort of helps

244
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,650
a little bit.

245
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:17,170
>> So one big block in the system can
really slow everybody else down.

246
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,570
And so what IP is going to do
is split this data into packets.

247
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:26,560
It's going to take this big email
or FTP transfer or a file transfer,

248
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,700
or maybe I'm making a
request to a web browser

249
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,205
because I want a picture of cat.

250
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:33,570
And it's going to take that
request or that email or that file

251
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,950
and break it up into many pieces and
send all of the pieces separately.

252
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,120
So in fact, I'm filling the highway
with a lot of small cars, which can all

253
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,320
move instead of a big truck that
might, if something goes wrong,

254
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,970
throttle the traffic for everybody else.

255
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,850
>> Another side effect
of this is if there's

256
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,170
some sort of catastrophic
failure and something goes wrong

257
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,890
and the packet gets dropped.

258
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,670
Something is failed and the
message can't be communicated.

259
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,090
The router maybe had
too much stuff going in.

260
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,340
It couldn't juggle everything.

261
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,840
And so it just literally dropped it.

262
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,630
That's sort of the analogy, right?

263
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,046
>> It's got a lot of things going on.

264
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,010
It's passing information
from point A to point

265
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,090
B. We're not the only two
people on the internet,

266
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,264
so it has to process a lot of traffic.

267
00:12:16,264 --> 00:12:19,430
And if it doesn't have enough hands and
it can't figure out what it's doing,

268
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,350
it might just drop something.

269
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,570
So it can do something else.

270
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,390
It's got too much going on.

271
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,560
>> If we had our message as one huge
block and that was what got dropped,

272
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,770
now we have to send the message again.

273
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,500
And we are now possibly
causing traffic again.

274
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,640
And we run the risk of that
huge block being dropped again.

275
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,060
But if the data's been broken up into
packets and we drop one of those,

276
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,100
it's a lot less costly to send that
packet one more time as opposed

277
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,220
to the entire thing one more time.

278
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,680
So IP is responsible for getting
information from point A to point B

279
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,500
and also breaking the
information into small pieces

280
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,880
so that the network isn't overly taxed.

281
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,760
>> IP is also known as a
connectionless protocol.

282
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,350
There's not necessarily a defined path
from the sender to the receiver or vice

283
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,850
versa.

284
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,808
Now, in this example we've talked
about, there actually is only one way

285
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:11,020
to get to every network.

286
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,110
So in this particular
illustration, there actually

287
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,560
is a defined path from
point A to point B.

288
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,270
But we can change that by just making
one modification to the two routers

289
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,640
on the left by adding this
condition to the router tables.

290
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,960
>> Now notice that from
the top left router,

291
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,340
there are actually two ways to deal
with a four or a five IP address.

292
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,100
It can go down to the lower left
router, or can go to the right,

293
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,090
to the right router.

294
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,532
It has multiple options.

295
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:37,240
And this is actually
kind of a good thing

296
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,690
because it makes our
network more responsive.

297
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,510
>> If for example-- it's
sort of like a GPS.

298
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,760
If you've ever been
driving on the highway

299
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,610
and suddenly your GPS warns
you that traffic is ahead,

300
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,230
you want to avoid it if you can.

301
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,710
And so you can recalculate your route.

302
00:13:53,710 --> 00:14:00,330
And a router network, in
addition to having information

303
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,110
about where packets should
go or where data should go,

304
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,140
there's also sort of this general pulse
on the state of its local network.

305
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,930
What's going to happen if I send
it down this path versus this path?

306
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:19,640
>> And so in light of heavy traffic
situations on the network, maybe

307
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,630
things will get routed a more
inefficient way or a more generally

308
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,939
inefficient way, because
if we go the regular way,

309
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:26,480
there's going to be a lot of traffic.

310
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,470
The highway is completely jammed.

311
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,880
So maybe what we'll do is
instead take side roads, which

312
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,070
ordinarily would take a
lot more time, but no one's

313
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,320
really using those side roads.

314
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,300
And so we can route
our packets that way.

315
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,190
>> So not every packet
of a big chunk of data

316
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,620
might take the same path from
the beginning to the end.

317
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,080
And our network becomes
a lot more responsive

318
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,720
if our router tables allow for there
to be multiple options for where to go.

319
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,054
We're not depending on that one
truck moving out of the way.

320
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:55,970
We can get off the highway at the
next exit and take a different path.

321
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:01,250
And so the Internet Protocol sort
of does a little bit of that, too.

322
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,110
>> So that's the basics of
the Internet Protocol.

323
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,780
But there's one more
issue to deal with, which

324
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,810
is what happens if we do drop a packet?

325
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,490
How do we know we're going
to send that packet again?

326
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,750
Right?

327
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,632
Well, Internet Protocol
doesn't guarantee delivery.

328
00:15:18,632 --> 00:15:20,590
We're going to be depending
on another protocol

329
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,027
to deal with that called
