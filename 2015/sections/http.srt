1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,950

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,310
>> SPEAKER: Let's talk about another
protocol-- the Hypertext Transfer

3
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,060
Protocol, or HTTP.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,074
So we've talked about IP
and TCP in previous videos.

5
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:17,240
And those are protocols
that dictate how information

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,970
moves from machine to machine and
from program to program or service

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,720
to service via the internet, via
this network of routers and machines.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,640
>> But that's usually not
the entire picture, right?

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,530
Usually when we send
information, the program

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,570
itself-- when data is
received, say, for example,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:44,270
in email via TCP port 25 or a
web page request via port 80,

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,220
there's usually a system of rules there
to process what I've just received.

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,960
And HTTP is an example
of just such a protocol.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,929
>> HTTP is the only
application layer protocol

15
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,220
that we're going to talk about.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,660
But it is another set
of rules dictating how

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,790
information is to be transmitted
and processed via the internet.

18
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,390
In particular, HTTP
specifies exactly how

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,300
one must make a request for
a web page and exactly how

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,160
a server, a machine
that hosts web pages,

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,840
delivers that information
back to clients.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,010
>> So this protocol doesn't
actually have anything

23
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,270
to do with how information
moves from point A

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,090
to point B. It's really
the system of rules

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,700
for-- it's basically the rules of
engagement for working with a web page,

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,960
similar to when somebody
waves their hand at you,

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,410
you're supposed to wave back.

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,280
That's sort of a
conventional human protocol.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,610
HTTP protocol just says, if
you want to request a web

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,730
page, make sure your format looks
like this-- sort of like formatting

31
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,930
a business letter, for example.

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,029
And the response will similarly
come according to this protocol.

33
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:51,820
There are other
application layer protocols

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,380
that we're not going to
talk about in videos.

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,790
But these include things like
the File Transfer Protocol,

36
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,200
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for
sending emails, the Data Distribution

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,100
Service, Remote Desktop
Protocol, RDP, which

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,590
is used if you want to remotely access
your computer from another computer,

39
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,479
XMPP, which is frequently
known as Jabber or chat,

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,160
so this is the protocol
for using chat services.

41
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,310
And there are many, many, many others.

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,900
>> So every time you're using
a service, the service

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,930
is expecting information
to be received-- a request

44
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,010
to be received-- in a
very particular format

45
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,070
and is required to
return information back

46
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:27,190
in a very particular format as well.

47
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,750
>> So let's go back to our illustration
of us wanting to talk to the internet.

48
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,810
So we're happy, and we want
to go to cats.com, right?

49
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,550
So if we're just talking to cats.com,
we might say something like hey,

50
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,720
can I see your home page?

51
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,320
And cats.com will probably
respond, yeah, sure.

52
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,440
Here you go.

53
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,440
So that's a human sort
of ask-and-answer.

54
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,980
>> What does that look like in HTTP?

55
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,340
Well, it actually kind of translates
pretty cleanly to something like this.

56
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:57,290
We might say GET/HTTP/1.1
from host cats.com.

57
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,039
So basically what I'm doing here is
asking for the web page www.cats.com/.

58
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,330
We usually omit the slash
nowadays, but that would just

59
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,200
mean cats.com's homepage.

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,910
>> Oh, and by the way, I'm going
to be using HTTP version

61
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,182
1.1 to communicate with you.

62
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:16,390
That's sort of analogous to
saying, like, by the way,

63
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,870
I'm going to be speaking
in French, or by the way,

64
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,370
I'm going to be speaking in English.

65
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,160
That's just the format of the protocol.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,050
It's also 1.0, which is
not commonly used anymore.

67
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,615
So I'm speaking HTTP 1.1, and
I would like www.cats.com/.

68
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:31,710
Please get that for me.

69
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,610
>> And then there's other information,
too-- the dot, dot, dot there,

70
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,234
which is information about
who you are so cats.com

71
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:39,400
would know where to send it.

72
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,480
But these are the two
sort of critical parts

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,000
at the very beginning
of an HTTP request--

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,770
just like when you start a
letter you say, dear, blank.

75
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,710
This is very similar in spirit to that.

76
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,370
>> And if cats.com is going to
say, oh, sure, here you go.

77
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,590
They might respond like
this-- I'm also responding.

78
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,960
I also speak HTTP 1.1.

79
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,720
Your request is approved, 200 OK.

80
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,709
What you're about to
receive is HTML and then

81
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:06,250
dot, dot, dot some extra information.

82
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,620
And at the very bottom of the
request is actually the HTML,

83
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,339
the markup language, the
content of cats.com's homepage.

84
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:21,227
>> So HTTP/1.1-- I acknowledge your
request was accepted via HTTP 1.1.

85
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,310
Your request was approved.

86
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,810
I can give you what you want, 200 OK.

87
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,440
You're about to receive HTML.

88
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,450
And then here's the
HTML that you requested.

89
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,930
>> But sometimes our requests don't
always go quite according to plan.

90
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,100
Can I see your cats.html page?

91
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,366
Well, what if they say, we
don't have a cats.html page,

92
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,740
which seems kind of unrealistic
because they're cats.com.

93
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,400
You'd think they would have cats.html.

94
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,420
But OK.

95
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,484
So this is sort of the
conventional human interaction

96
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:49,650
we've now had with cats.com.

97
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,060
How does that translate?

98
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,726
>> This might be something familiar to you.

99
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,690
Our request looked exactly the same,
except instead of getting slash

100
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,110
we're now getting cats.html.

101
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,810
So now what basically this entire
request is saying is please give me

102
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,620
www.cats.com/cats.html.

103
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,700
So the host and the middle
part of that top line

104
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,632
there indicate precisely
what page I am asking for.

105
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,590
But cats.com in this case isn't going
to be able to respond positively.

106
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,089
They don't know we're talking about.

107
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:25,170
And so this is something you might have
seen before-- HTTP 1.1 404 Not Found.

108
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,180
I couldn't find what
you were asking for.

109
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,460
By the way, I'm going to give you
back some HTML, and usually that HTML

110
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,351
is the content of some 404 page.

111
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:34,100
And in the case of
cats.com, it's probably

112
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,720
some cute cats in a basket with
a sad 404 face next to them,

113
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,920
because you're going to be
sad when you don't get page

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,040
that you were looking for.

115
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,520
>> That's kind of the basics of what a
protocol, the HTTP protocol requests

116
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,180
look like.

117
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,640
They're really similar to how we
would make a similar interaction

118
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,460
in just human conventions
asking for something

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,250
and getting it back or writing a
letter and expecting a response

120
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,380
letter in a particular format.

121
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,910
That's pretty much what
HTTP is just canonicalizing

122
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:10,190
for all devices that wish to access
web pages, hypertext transfers.

123
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,110
>> So a line of the form, this the
method request target HTTP version,

124
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,100
is called an HTTP request line.

125
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,740
It's usually the first thing that is
transmitted as part of an HTTP request

126
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,180
or if you're asking for HTTP.

127
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,970
It's sort of like, as I said, saying
dear, blank at the top your letter.

128
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,880
They know that you're
writing them a letter.

129
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,796
So this is very similar
to saying, I know

130
00:06:34,796 --> 00:06:37,670
that they're making an HTTP request
and this is the particular format

131
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,090
they're asking for.

132
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,810
>> HTTP version is probably
always going to be HTTP/1/1.

133
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,670
1.0 also exists but isn't
really used anymore.

134
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,200
For purposes of CS50,
GET is probably always

135
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,540
what you're going to be
using when you're actually

136
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,250
making direct HTTP requests.

137
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,720
But POST is another option that we're
not going to talk about right now.

138
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,980
And then request-target is
what page on the host's server

139
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,812
you would like to get.

140
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:08,020
As I said, that host name
is a separate line, usually

141
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,350
the second line of the overall request.

142
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,660
And so taken together, the host
name and the request target

143
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,070
specify a specific
resource being sought.

144
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,986
In our 404 example a second ago, I
was asking again for www.cats.com,

145
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:22,940
cats.com being the host.

146
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,300
And in my request line,
I said /cats.html.

147
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,790
That was my request target.

148
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,200
So overall I was asking for the
contents or the resource located

149
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,410
at www.cats.com/cats.html.

150
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,870
>> And then based on whether
the resource exists

151
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,160
and whether the server can deliver
the resource pursuant to the client's

152
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,760
request, you might get
various status codes back.

153
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,280
Some of these status codes you've seen
because they're part of the response.

154
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,580
Some of them, 200 OK, are
probably pretty silent.

155
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,650
You've probably never seen
a page respond 200 OK.

156
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,890
You just get the page.

157
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,260
It's not like a 404 error,
which is usually pretty clear.

158
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,850
You usually see that it says 404.

159
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,880
>> So let's talk about what some
of those status codes might be.

160
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,660
Again, when the server
responds to us, they're

161
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,120
going to respond HTTP version status.

162
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,020
Usually HTTP/1.1.

163
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,410
What are these status codes going to be?

164
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,890
Well, we might get a success.

165
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:23,617
So in the success category, we
might get code 200 with the text OK.

166
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:24,450
What does this mean?

167
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,491
Well, everything is good.

168
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,721
You made a valid request.

169
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:27,720
Here's a valid response.

170
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,060
I was able to deliver
exactly what you wanted.

171
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,080
>> Sometimes you might get other things
that you won't notice right away

172
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,140
but are somewhat failures.

173
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,422
They're called redirections.

174
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:37,630
There's two common ones here.

175
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,520
301 Moved Permanently--
what this basically means

176
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,559
is the page is now at a new location.

177
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,920
It will live there forever.

178
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,150
And most browsers will
automatically redirect you.

179
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,860
So you'll never really see
a 301, either, unless you're

180
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,210
using a really out-of-date
browser, possibly,

181
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,660
because the 301 response is part of
the dot, dot, dot of the 301 response.

182
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,577
It also tells you where the new page is.

183
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,660
And so most browsers will
just redirect you there,

184
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,570
assuming that you want to go there.

185
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,440
>> Sometimes you'll also get 302 Found.

186
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,850
And this one you actually
might still see occasionally.

187
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,720
Sometimes pages move temporarily.

188
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,570
So it's not going to be built into
the request telling the browser

189
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,740
to permanently change any time
it sees the request that you

190
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,255
make to change it to something else.

191
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:21,210
So you might see 302
Found, which basically

192
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,710
says this page lives somewhere else.

193
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,418
But it's not going to
live there forever.

194
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:29,052
It will eventually probably go
back to where you think it is.

195
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:31,780
>> Then you'll get things
like client errors.

196
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,012
So these are ones you've
probably seen, now.

197
00:09:34,012 --> 00:09:35,970
You probably haven't seen
the 200s or the 300s,

198
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,370
but you're probably
familiar with the 400s.

199
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,130
And that's what we'll talk
about in a second, 500s as well.

200
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,580
>> You might see 401 Unauthorized.

201
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,100
Usually this means you're
trying to access a page,

202
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,230
but you haven't logged in.

203
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,500
So you try and go to some
profile or something on Facebook

204
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,106
or you try and access
some-- you're at work.

205
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:56,619
You're trying to access something
on your work's internet,

206
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:57,660
but you're not logged in.

207
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,740
You can't see the page.

208
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,770
You might get a 401 unauthorized,
which means we probably

209
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,590
will be able to satisfy this request,
but first you need to log in to do so.

210
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,590
>> Conversely, you might get 403
Forbidden, which is it doesn't really

211
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,490
matter if you're logged in or not.

212
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,020
This request isn't allowed.

213
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,320
The resource exists on the server.

214
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,817
But you are not allowed to access it.

215
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,900
This is usually internal files that
live on the server for various reasons

216
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,860
but are not intended to be
accessed from the outside world,

217
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,030
and so they are forbidden.

218
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,120
They live there.

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,440
I'm not saying I can't find it.

220
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,030
But I'm saying I cannot give it to you.

221
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,071
And it doesn't matter if
you're logged in or not.

222
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:35,479
And then of course, the
very common 404 Not Found.

223
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:37,020
The file doesn't exist on the server.

224
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,200
I would like to satisfy
your request, but I can't.

225
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,390
>> You also sometimes see server
errors, the most common generally

226
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,990
being 500 Internal Server Error, which
doesn't actually tell you anything

227
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,200
at all about what has gone wrong.

228
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,290
But it's not actually you making
a mistake in your request.

229
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,200
It's actually the server failing
to deliver on the request somehow.

230
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,040
So 500 is the general response.

231
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,190
>> You'll also see something
like Service Unavailable,

232
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,720
which I believe is code 503.

233
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,882
And Gateway Timeout-- if
you ever had a page just

234
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,590
sit there loading and
loading and loading

235
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,715
and you never know if it's going to
load and then eventually it just says--

236
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,650
just gives up.

237
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,460
That's a 504 Gateway Timeout.

238
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,600
The server wanted to
execute your request,

239
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,930
but something went wrong
on the server side--

240
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,452
not on your side-- to
cause that to be a problem.

241
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:27,410
Now, we could end the story here,
but what I'm actually going to do now

242
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,368
is I'm going to open up
my browser and show you

243
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:32,250
how you might be able to see
some of these status codes

244
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,580
even if you don't generally see them.

245
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,090
And we're going to do that by taking
a look at some developer tools.

246
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,050
>> All right So here I am
now in my browser window.

247
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,840
And I want to learn a little bit
more about these HTTP requests.

248
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,060
How do I know-- certainly we know if a
page goes-- when something goes wrong,

249
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,630
we get a 404.

250
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,465
We've all seen that.

251
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:51,840
We don't need to illustrate that.

252
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,048
But what are some other ones?

253
00:11:53,048 --> 00:11:56,850
And how would we see
these requests in action?

254
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,990
>> So first thing I'm going to
do is open up Developer Tools.

255
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,580
So Developer Tools are built
into most modern browsers

256
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,020
and allow us to see things
that we don't otherwise

257
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,580
see-- some extra information sort of
being transmitted underneath our web

258
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,500
requests.

259
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,790
I'm using Google Chrome here.

260
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,900
And to open Developer Tools
in Chrome, you just hit F-12,

261
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,729
and it's going to open
it up on the side.

262
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,770
Once I type the request, I'll zoom in
so we can see what's going on here.

263
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:28,530
But what I'm going to do in my browser
bar is-- and I'll zoom in over here--

264
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,427
I will make a request to www.google.com.

265
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:34,260
We've all probably made
this request before.

266
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm going to hit Enter.

267
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,920

268
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,400
>> Now, over here in my Developer
Tools, I've chosen the Network tab.

269
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,010
And you notice a lot of things here.

270
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,732
Look at these-- 200 OK, 200 OK, some
of these status codes coming up.

271
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:53,356
I don't know why I'm getting 302 Found.

272
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,860
I didn't realize I'd see that one.

273
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,192
But basically notice that pretty
much, in terms of my Google request--

274
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:00,150
I made a very simple
request for Google's page.

275
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,890
And in the process of
delivering my request,

276
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,670
Google has apparently made a lot
of other requests on my behalf.

277
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:11,990
>> But I've made a get request for Google's
page and I'm getting a lot of 200 OKs.

278
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,830
I'm not seeing 200 OK on
my screen, but I'm getting

279
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,170
a lot of requests that have been made.

280
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,550
One more that I'm pretty
sure is going to work

281
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,920
is-- for those of you who
are really old-school,

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,012
you may know that Facebook was
not always at Facebook.com.

283
00:13:26,012 --> 00:13:29,780
In its early days it was
at wwww.thefacebook.com.

284
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,560
They apparently could not get access
to Facebook.com for quite awhile.

285
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,870
>> And so what I'm expecting
here is to get information.

286
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,315
And we'll see if this pans out.

287
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:39,190
What I'm expecting here
is to get information

288
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,980
that Facebook has moved permanently
from thefacebook.com to Facebook.com.

289
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,830
So I'm expecting somewhere
near the top of my requests

290
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,730
over in my Developer Tools
to get a 301 notification

291
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,580
that Facebook has moved permanently.

292
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,070
Again, I won't see 301
on my browser screen.

293
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,380
And because it's a 301,
it's a permanent move.

294
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,500
My browser, being that
it's a modern browser,

295
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,110
is probably going to redirect
me to Facebook.com anyway.

296
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,260
But let's see what happens.

297
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,340
>> And now I'm going to
go to thefacebook.com.

298
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,370
And yep, there it is right at the top.

299
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,390
It went away, but it was there.

300
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,820
Let me scroll up here.

301
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,004

302
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:18,920
Right here at the top.

303
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,080
I made a request to thefacebook.com,
and I'm getting a response

304
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,410
that this page has moved permanently.

305
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,770
And then 307 here is
an internal redirect.

306
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,680
And so this is what has actually
moved me to the much more

307
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,330
familiar www.facebook.com.

308
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:38,480
>> So these response codes do still
happen, even if we don't see them.

309
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,710
I'm not going to
illustrate 401, 403, 404,

310
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,090
because you've probably seen
those at various points.

311
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,740
And 500, I would just be
kind of-- we'd get lucky

312
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,380
if got a 500 because we don't know what
servers are currently down anywhere.

313
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,060
But these codes do
exist, and there is a way

314
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,610
to access them even if we don't
see them firsthand on our systems.

315
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,530
I'm Doug Lloyd.

316
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,570
This is CS50.

317
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,557
